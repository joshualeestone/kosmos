# launchpath-5516: the token-only guard also protects the folders on the agent's launch PATH (kosmos#5516, part 1)

Stacked on boardkeychain-4491 (#5122); rebased onto main once that merges. Route detail and measurements are kept in
Angel's private notes; this plan stays at the level of the class.

## Finished looks like
A token-only Claude agent's own file tools and shell cannot write into the folders on the PATH it starts with, or
the folders the programs there live in. Anything that cannot be covered makes the guard say it is not whole, and the
rest of the guard is still written.

## Built
- engine/setup-assistant.js: launchPathDirs (the pane PATH from the supervisor, the board's own PATH, two fixed
  folders, and the folders the programs on them live in); an Edit deny and a sandbox denyWrite for each.
- bin/agent-supervisor.sh: abs_path_only cleans the pane PATH, and the pane and the guard are given the same one.
- engine/launchpath-5516.test.js.

## Decided
- Computed at each refresh (board start, and each launch with the pane's own PATH), not from a fixed list.
- Never a partial write: an uncoverable entry is reported, the rest of the guard is written.
- An ancestor of the agent folder is never denied (it would lock the agent out of its own work).
- Deny lists merge, so a folder once covered stays covered (only narrows what the agent may write).

## Review log
- Round 1 (opus): 2 BLOCKER, 4 WARNING, 2 CONVENTION, 1 NIT. Fixed, or recorded privately for measurement.
- Round 2 (sonnet): 0 BLOCKER, 5 WARNING, 1 CONVENTION, 2 NIT. Fixed (ancestors, an empty cleaned PATH, the board
  PATH held loosely, a runnable test of the cleaning, public text cut back, one scan per refresh pass).
- Round 3 (opus; a fresh review by Renet Tilley, who took the card over, since round 3's own findings were not recorded):
  - FIXED (BLOCKER): a launch folder with a rule-pattern character no longer stops the whole guard from being written.
    Its file-tool rule is left out and the folder reported (the guard says it is not whole), and the shell layer keeps
    its concrete path. Test with a control; the mutation makes it fail.
  - FIXED: PATH entries that do not exist yet resolve through a symlinked parent (realOrLeaf). Test with a control;
    the mutation makes it fail.
  - FIXED: the comments claim only what is covered.
  - OPEN, the next work on this card: programs the supervisor starts by absolute path from folders not on the pane
    PATH (its own engine scripts, node, tmux, the Claude binary). They are to be passed to the guard as well. Measure
    first which are writable by the agent's file tools.
  - OPEN, a recorded residual until decided: code a covered program loads from beside it (a package's lib, a keg's
    dylibs). The candidate is to widen coverage to the package or keg root.
