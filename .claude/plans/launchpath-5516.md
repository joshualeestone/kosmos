# launchpath-5516: the token-only guard also protects the folders on the agent's launch PATH (kosmos#5516, part 1)

Stacked on boardkeychain-4491 (#5122); rebased onto main once that merges. Route detail and measurements are kept in
Angel's private notes; this plan stays at the level of the class.

## Finished looks like
A token-only Claude agent's own file tools and shell cannot write into the folders on the PATH it starts with, or
the folders the programs there live in. Anything that cannot be covered makes the guard say it is not whole, and the
rest of the guard is still written.

## Built
- engine/setup-assistant.js: launchPathDirs (the pane PATH from the supervisor, the board's own PATH, two fixed
  folders, and the folders the programs on them live in); an Edit deny and a sandbox denyWrite for each.
- bin/agent-supervisor.sh: abs_path_only cleans the pane PATH, and the pane and the guard are given the same one.
- engine/launchpath-5516.test.js.

## Decided
- Computed at each refresh (board start, and each launch with the pane's own PATH), not from a fixed list.
- Never a partial write: an uncoverable entry is reported, the rest of the guard is written.
- An ancestor of the agent folder is never denied (it would lock the agent out of its own work).
- Deny lists merge, so a folder once covered stays covered (only narrows what the agent may write).

## Review log
- Round 1 (opus): 2 BLOCKER, 4 WARNING, 2 CONVENTION, 1 NIT. Fixed, or recorded privately for measurement.
- Round 2 (sonnet): 0 BLOCKER, 5 WARNING, 1 CONVENTION, 2 NIT. Fixed (ancestors, an empty cleaned PATH, the board
  PATH held loosely, a runnable test of the cleaning, public text cut back, one scan per refresh pass).
