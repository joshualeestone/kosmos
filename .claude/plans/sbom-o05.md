# sbom-o05: a bill of materials for each release (external review item O05)

The external review asks for an SBOM of what ships. Kosmos has none. This adds `tools/lib/sbom.js`, which writes a
CycloneDX 1.5 JSON SBOM for one Mac release, derived only from records that already exist:
- **the release's signed manifest:** version, tarball sha, app commit, Node version and download sha, the connector's
  signed sha and its relay commit;
- **the tmux bundle the release shipped** (`tmux-<arch>.tar.gz`, given with `--tmux`), which must hash to the
  manifest's signed `tmux_sha256`: its VERSION file names the tmux, libevent, ncurses and utf8proc that were built,
  and every dylib in its `lib/` must belong to one of them. Review 3 found the first versions of this tool read the
  versions from the build SCRIPT; but a release copies an already-built bundle and does not rebuild it (release.sh
  step 4), so a pin bumped without a rebuild would have listed a version users do not have;
- **`tools/build-tmux-from-source.sh` at the app commit:** only for each input's download url and source sha256, and
  only where its pinned version equals the bundle's; otherwise the component carries a `kosmos:source-pin` property
  saying what differs, and no source reference. Every `fetch` call is read, anywhere on a line, and one in a shape
  it cannot read, or a `*_URL` nothing fetches, refuses;
- **the relay's `Cargo.lock` at the connector commit:** walked from `kosmos-tunnel-client` to every crate it reaches,
  with each crate's DIRECT dependencies as the CycloneDX dependency graph. A crate from a source the tool does not know
  (not crates.io exactly, not git) refuses the whole SBOM rather than being left out, and so does a sourceless crate
  that is not a member of the relay workspace (a vendored crate would otherwise pass as first-party).

The app has no npm dependencies (package.json lists none) and the Swift app links Apple frameworks only, so that is
all the third-party code in the bundle.

## Why derived, not generated at build time
Any served release's SBOM can be rebuilt later, on any machine, from its signed manifest. The manifest is signed, so
the inputs are the ones the release vouched for. The same release always gives a byte-identical file (the serial
number is derived from the tarball sha).

## Checked
- **Real release, 0.7.59 (served manifest and the served tmux bundle, whose sha256 equals the signed tmux_sha256):**
  235 components:
  - node 24.19.0, the tmux bundle, tmux 3.5a, libevent 2.1.12-stable, ncurses 6.5, utf8proc 2.9.0, the connector;
  - the control: a bundle with one byte appended refuses ("not the one this release signed");
  - 227 registry crates and 1 first-party crate.
  - It passes the official CycloneDX 1.5 JSON schema (ajv), and a copy with one bad component type fails it.
  - Purl versions are percent-encoded (`wasi@0.11.1%2Bwasi-snapshot-preview1`).
  - It is byte-identical under the C, en_US and da_DK locales (code-point order; locale-aware sorting changed it under
    da_DK, found in review 1).
  - The control: rustls reads 0.23.43, the version that release shipped before the O05 fix (#457, 0.23.46).
- **Against `cargo tree` (review 1, offline, locked):** none of its 189 macOS crates is missing. Of the 40 extras,
  26 are Windows-only or dev-only and 14 are optional dependencies of features the connector does not turn on (h2 and
  untrusted 0.7.1 among them). So a scan of this SBOM must treat an advisory on an extra crate as NOT shipped until it
  checks the macOS build graph; the header says so.
- **`tools.sbom-o05.test.js`:** 15 arms, 14 through injected git reads and an injected bundle (no relay checkout needed
  in CI) and 1 through the command line against two git repos and a tarball it makes (tmpscope). Twenty-nine mutants
  each fail an arm (four from the first version, eight after review 1, six after review 2, eleven after review 3:
  the bundle's hash unchecked, an unaccounted dylib, a vendored crate as first-party, a crates.io prefix match, fetch
  calls read only at the start of a line, an unfetched url accepted, a version variable unchecked, a dirty build
  accepted, an unreadable dependency line skipped, no leaf entries, and drift between the script and the bundle not
  flagged).
- **Every refusal names what it could not read,** so a new build-script shape fails loudly at SBOM time instead of
  going missing (review 2: the fetch-line approach is only as good as its refusal on a line it cannot parse).
- **Full-suite-only guards:** every-test-runs, all-node-tests-considered, engine.reachable, #1732, #1777 and the mktemp
  lint pass.

## Not in this PR (named, owner Baron)
- **Publishing:** the SBOM beside each release (`dist/kosmos-<V>-arm64.cdx.json`), written at release step 4b and
  covered by the signed manifest. A release-surface change, so a separate PR after the 0.7.60 hold lifts.
- **The vulnerability scan:** a CI job that checks the SBOM's purls against OSV (the scan done by hand for O05 found
  the rustls advisories). Next.
- **Windows:** the Windows bundle's SBOM, once its signed manifest (#6607) ships.

## Weakest premise
That the lockfile closure is an acceptable SBOM for the connector. It over-lists (Windows and test crates) rather than
under-lists. A reviewer may prefer the exact macOS build graph (`cargo tree --target aarch64-apple-darwin -e normal`),
but that needs a relay checkout with cargo at SBOM time and loses the any-machine property.
