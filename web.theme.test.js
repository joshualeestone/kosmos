 * cannot be a media query, so every dark rule has to exist twice: once for
 * "this Mac is dark" and once for "this person chose dark". Two copies of
 * anything drift, and this pair drifts INVISIBLY -- the app looks right in
 * whichever mode the author happened to be in.
 *
 * So the second copy is generated (`tools/sync-forced-theme.js`) and these
 * tests fail the moment the checked-in file stops matching what the generator
 * would produce.
