/**
 * ONE fixture, for every test on either side of the status seam.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is worth reading before using it.
 *
 * Three challenge-loop rounds in a row found the same defect, and none of them
 * were in the code under test. They were in the FIXTURES:
 *
 *   - The projects suite handed `describe()` a roster carrying `name`, `state`
 *     and `because`. `paneRoster()` has never returned those fields. Every test
 *     was green while production rendered machine names, a permanently zero
 *     "needs you" count, and "Can't tell" with no reason.
 *   - The route suite stubbed tmux with `/bin/echo`, which is not the seam the
 *     status engine reads at all, so its roster was permanently null and not one
 *     route test ever asserted a present member.
 *   - Pane lines are hand-typed tab-separated strings, so the column a value
 *     lands in is maintained by counting `\t` by eye. One line in `server.test.js`
 *     puts a pane TITLE in the `claim` column, where a matching value would have
 *     made a stranger's session read as ours.
 *
 * All three are one shape: **a test measuring a world the producer does not
 * produce.** Measuring against the wrong world is worse than not measuring,
 * because it manufactures confidence. So the fix is not another comment. It is a
 * mechanism: every fleet in the suite is described HERE, and everything this
 * module hands back was built by the REAL producers — `snapshot()` and
 * `paneRoster()` — from a pane listing assembled out of `PANE_COLUMNS` by NAME.
 *
 * ⚠️ SAID PRECISELY, because the first version of this paragraph claimed this is
 * "the only sanctioned way for a test to obtain a fleet" and that is not true.
 * There are two tiers, and only the first gets all four guarantees below:
 *
 *   - `install()` — the full fixture. Sets the seam, runs the real producers,
 *     verifies its own arrangement, hands back strict cards and rows. Used where
 *     a test asserts on what the board SAYS.
 *   - `line()` alone — the pane listing only, for the ~19 places that install
 *     the seam themselves because they need to change the answer between two
 *     reads (tied when the plan looks, untied by the time the write happens) or
 *     to have it throw. Those get guarantee 2 (named columns) and NOT 1, 3 or 4.
 *
 * That second tier is a real gap rather than a completed job, and the lint in
 * `fixture-discipline.test.js` is scoped to what it actually enforces: no
 * hand-typed pane line, no hand-built card. It does not claim every test goes
 * through `install()`, because they do not.
 *
 * What that buys, concretely:
 *
 *   1. A test cannot carry a field the producer does not emit, because it never
 *      writes the object. It asks for one.
 *   2. A test cannot put a value in the wrong column, because it names the
 *      column instead of counting tabs.
 *   3. Production code that reads a field off a fixture object the producer does
 *      not emit THROWS, loudly, naming the producer (see `strict` below) —
 *      rather than reading `undefined` and passing. That alone would have caught
 *      the worst defect on this branch the first time it was written.
 *   4. A test cannot silently get a state it did not ask for: `install` verifies
 *      each spec's intended state against what the real classifier actually
 *      answered, and throws if they disagree. A fixture that means to arrange
 *      "an agent asking a question" and arranges `unknown` instead is a vacuous
 *      test, and vacuous tests are the other half of this same class.
 *
 * ⚠️ REQUIRE IT AFTER THE SANDBOX, like every other engine module. It pulls in
 * `engine/status`, which reads its roots ONCE at require time. Requiring this
 * before `process.env.AGENT_WORKFORCE_*` is set sandboxes nothing.
 *
 *   const fleet = require('../test-support/fleet');   // from engine/
 *   const board = fleet.install([
 *     fleet.agent('mara', { state: 'working' }),
 *     fleet.agent('claudebot', { displayName: 'Splinter', state: 'needs_you' }),
 *   ]);
 *   try {
 *     projects.list(board.agents);          // the real snapshot() cards
 *     gate(board.roster);                   // the real paneRoster() rows
 *   } finally {
 *     board.restore();
 *   }
