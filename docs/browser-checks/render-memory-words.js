/**
 * Measure the two unknown-memory captions on all three surfaces that draw them,
 * in a real browser.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. Every other test of this change reads text, and text
 * cannot see layout. The captions are absolutely positioned, centred under
 * their avatar and set to `white-space: nowrap`, and the CSS beside them
 * carries measurements taken once, years of edits ago — one of which this check
 * proved wrong on its first run ("the caption is 105px wide"; it is 62px).
 * "Not yet read" is five characters longer than "Unknown", so whether it still
 * clears the name below and stays inside its card is a question only a renderer
 * can answer.
 *
 * 🔑 IT MEASURES IN THE PAGE, never from a picture. `getBoundingClientRect` and
 * `getComputedStyle` are mode-independent; screenshots are not, because
 * headless renders through SwiftShader and headed through the Metal
 * compositor, and the two differ on every file.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT CHECKS THE CAPTION IS VISIBLE, not merely present. An earlier
 * version measured geometry only, which a caption at `opacity: 0` satisfies
 * perfectly — the fully transparent modal this directory exists because of.
 *
 * Run:
 *   PW=$(mktemp -d); cd "$PW" && npm init -y && npm i playwright \
 *     && npx playwright install chromium
 *   NODE_PATH="$PW/node_modules" node docs/browser-checks/render-memory-words.js
 *
 * ⚠️ `NODE_PATH` is not optional: `require` resolves from THIS file's directory.
 * ⚠️ HEADED by default, matching every other check here. `HEADED=0` for a
 *    machine with no console session; the verdicts are the same either way,
 *    which is the point of asserting geometry rather than comparing images.
