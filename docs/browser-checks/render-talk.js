/* The agent page's own thread: the question, the option buttons, the composer,
 * and every state the drawing names, in both themes.
 * Run: NODE_PATH=$HOME/work/pw-runtime/node_modules node docs/browser-checks/render-talk.js
 *      (HEADED=0 on a machine with no console session)
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT EXERCISE. Unlike its siblings here, it does
 * NOT spawn server.js: it loads the page over file:// and answers the poll from
 * fixtures, because the states worth looking at (an agent that cannot be
 * reached, a menu we refused to parse, a store that cannot be written) need a
 * machine state a sandboxed server has no way to be in. So it checks the PAINT
 * and not the route. The route is covered by the suite; the paint is what
 * `node --test` cannot see.
 *
 * It measures IN THE PAGE rather than judging from the picture: scrollWidth vs
 * clientWidth for overflow, computed backgrounds for the transparent-panel
 * class, and elementFromPoint for what is actually on top.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SCREENSHOTS ONLY REPRODUCE IN THE MODE THEY WERE MADE IN, and the
 * failure looks exactly like a visual regression. Measured 2026-08-20 against
 * the 26 committed under docs/screenshots:
 *
 *   headed    26 of 26 byte-identical
 *   headless  26 of 26 differ
 *
 * Both runs report `problems: none`, because the ASSERTIONS pass either way --
 * they measure in the page, which is mode-independent. The pixels are not:
 * headless is SwiftShader software rendering and headed is the Metal
 * compositor. So regenerating these with HEADED=0 produces a 26-file diff
 * that reads as "something changed on screen" and means "I rendered on a
 * different GPU". Regenerate HEADED, or expect to throw the diff away.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO THINGS IT LEARNED THE HARD WAY, both of which look like success:
 *   - Its first run screenshotted the FIRST-RUN OVERLAY with all eight states
 *     laid out correctly underneath it, every measurement green. A clip
 *     rectangle does not know what is painted over it.
 *   - Dismissing that overlay is not enough: the app sets `inert` on every body
 *     child while it is up. With inert left on, every elementFromPoint answers
 *     BODY and a Playwright click times out, on a page that screenshots
 *     perfectly. A picture cannot show you that nothing on it can be clicked.

      /* 6. A REPAINT WHERE ONLY THE CLOCK MOVED, on a thread long enough to
         scroll and new enough to say "a minute ago".
         ⚠️ THE SCROLL BLOCK'S OWN FIXTURES, 2c above, ARE DATED January 2026,
         so their verdict lines render a fixed "at 9:00 on Jan 1" and a repaint
         there is byte-identical. THIS block is the opposite on purpose: its
         thread is 65 seconds old so the phrase moves, which is the whole point
         of it.
         (Twice corrected and worth recording as one lesson. The sentence first
         said "every fixture in this file", which was a confident absolute the
         file contradicts -- `placed()` and `3-unconfirmed` both render relative
         phrases. The correction then said "the fixtures THIS block uses", which
         moved the claim onto the block that deliberately does the opposite. A
         wrong absolute replaced by a wrong referent: the fix for an
         over-general claim is a precise one, not a smaller general one.)
         That makes the scroll block above an honest test of
         "an unchanged list does not move", and NO test at all of the case the
         product actually spends its first hour in: `pjWhen` returns a RELATIVE
         phrase under an hour, so the markup changes once a minute on a thread
         nobody touched, `setThread` rewrites `innerHTML`, and the count key is
         unchanged so the jump-to-bottom arm does not fire. Whether that moves
         a reader is a question about the browser, not about this code, and the
         answer measured here (2026-08-20, Chromium, headed) is that it does
         not: a same-height rewrite keeps `scrollTop`. This block exists so the
         day that stops being true is a failure rather than a discovery. */
