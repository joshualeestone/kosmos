 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. The suite reads text. It cannot see a control that renders
 * transparent, a row whose warning has no contrast, or a panel that is present
 * in the DOM and invisible on screen — 316 tests and two blind reviews once
 * passed a fully transparent modal because nothing had ever rendered the page.
 * A screenshot is the only evidence that the thing a person opens is the thing
 * the tests describe.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT DRIVES THE REAL ROUTES. Every state below is set up by POSTing to the
 * running server, not by injecting markup — a fixture painted into the DOM
 * proves the CSS works on markup this page might never produce. So SANDBOX THE
 * SERVER YOU POINT IT AT. Unsandboxed, the membership writes rewrite the
 * instruction files that live agents boot from.
