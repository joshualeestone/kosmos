/**
 * Where a role's limit on what it reaches is READ, now that it is off the card.
 *
 * 🛑 WHY THIS IS RENDERED RATHER THAN GREPPED. The change this pins is a MOVE,
 * and a move is the one shape a source test cannot judge: the string is in the
 * file either way. `engine/roles.js` still carries the sentence, `web/index.html`
 * still mentions it in two places, and a grep for the words is green whether the
 * paragraph reaches a screen or sits hidden behind a role branch that never
 * runs. Only the page knows which.
 *
 * 🔑 AND THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR IS "NOWHERE". On 2026-08-22 the sentence
 * came off the create card at Josh's instruction and 0.2.91 shipped with it in
 * no user-facing place at all, for about twenty minutes. A caution that is
 * nowhere is not a styling regression, it is the product no longer disclosing
 * that a Project Manager briefs other agents on its own -- and the person finds
 * out after it has. So this asserts BOTH halves, off the card AND on the last
 * step, because either one alone passes in the state that caused the incident.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS A PATTERN, NOT A STRING. Nine of the twenty-eight roles carry a
 * limit, so the last step is checked against a SECOND role as well: a paint
 * hardcoded to the project manager would satisfy a one-role check completely.
 *
 * Headless is fine here and that is a claim, not a default: everything below is
 * visible text plus the vertical order of two elements, which is layout. It
 * would not be fine for a screenshot or anything about paint.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEEDS A SANDBOX WITH FIRST RUN ALREADY COMPLETE, and that is not a
 * convenience. A fresh sandbox opens onboarding over the whole app, and this
 * script cannot be trusted to notice: it did not, until the occlusion assertion
 * below was added. Seed the flag before starting the server --
 *
 *   mkdir -p "$SB/data/AgentWorkforce"
 *   echo '{"completedAt":"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"}' > "$SB/data/AgentWorkforce/first-run.json"
 *
 * Run: see the README in this directory.
