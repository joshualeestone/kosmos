/**
 * What the page says when the server it was loaded from stops answering (#269).
 *
 * 🔑 THE SERVER IS REALLY KILLED, not stubbed. The state under test is a fetch
 * that rejects against a host that is gone, which is the one thing a mock of
 * `fetch` cannot be wrong about in the same way: the page has to survive its own
 * poll failing, repaint its chrome, and keep the note up across later polls.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE IN-FLIGHT ARM IS ASSERTED FIRST, before the server dies. On a slow
 * machine the in-flight state and the failed state look identical to whoever is
 * writing the code, and a check that only looks after the failure passes on a
 * build that shows the note immediately.
 *
 *   AGENT_WORKFORCE_DATA=/tmp/on PORT=17451 node server.js &   # ...and pass $! as the third argument: this check kills THAT pid
 *   NODE_PATH="$HOME/work/pw-runtime/node_modules" \
 *     KOSMOS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:17451 node docs/browser-checks/render-offline-note.js /tmp/onshots
 *
 * ⚠️ HEADED by default. `HEADED=0` on a machine with no console session.
