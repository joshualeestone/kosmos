 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. `node --test` reads text. It cannot see a control that
 * renders transparent, a terminal viewport whose text has no contrast, or a
 * question box that is in the DOM and invisible on screen — this repo has
 * shipped all three, and 316 tests once went past a fully transparent modal
 * because nothing had ever put the page on a screen. A screenshot, plus a
 * measurement taken FROM the rendered page, is the only evidence that what a
 * person opens is what the tests describe.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MUST BE POINTED AT `thread-server.js`, NOT AT `node server.js`. This
 * screen SENDS: against a plain server on this machine, pressing Send would
 * type into a live agent's conversation. The fixture server stubs the pane
 * source and `chat`'s tmux runner so a Send reaches a log line and no further,
 * and this check REFUSES to run against anything else.

 * onto `thread-3-could-not-deliver.png` by hand is a step nobody will
 * reproduce, and a mismatched pair is how a stale image outlives the screen it

       - the removal probe, a 400 for untied agents (pre-existing);
       - the agent's own thread, a 404 for a borrowed name -- the
         `borrowedName` gate, which exists so one pane cannot serve the
         real agent's private conversation beside a stranger's card.

     Both are the product refusing correctly, and neither is suppressible
     from the page: a browser logs any 4xx response as a failed resource.
     Armed only around that block, so either probe failing anywhere else
     -- for a TIED agent, where neither refusal is by design -- still
     fails the run. The exemption is why the block below also ASSERTS
     what the refusal draws: a tolerated request that draws nothing is
     how a check turns into permission. */
  /* 🛑 THE 400 EXEMPTION IS KEYED ON SCOPE, NOT ON TIMING, and it had to be.
     It was armed around the block that opens the untied panel and disarmed

     and lands after the disarm. Measured on this branch AND on origin/main,
     four runs out of four, always

     everybody, on a product behaviour that is correct, and the failure says
     "console error" rather than "your window closed too early".

     A window defined by synchronous code position cannot contain an event
     that arrives later. Keyed on the untied agent's NAME instead, which is a
     property of the fixture rather than of the clock. `rook` is the only
     borrowed name this server serves, and the block below asserts that it
     really does arrive untied before relying on it.

     ⚠️ The property the armed version existed for SURVIVES: a TIED agent's
