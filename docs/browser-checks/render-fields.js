/**
 * The field and control invariants, measured in a real browser, in BOTH schemes.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. Two thirds of the `screen-pass` diff was CSS, and CSS had
 * no standing guard at all -- `node --test` reads source, and source is exactly
 * what lied. That branch found THREE separate rules that lost the cascade and
 * read in the diff as if they had worked (`#firstrun .inp` beating
 * `.fr-youfield input`, `#d-instr` beating the `.dbox` treatment, and a
 * `.agauge` margin that restated a value it already had). A rule that loses the
 * cascade is identical to a rule that is not there, and only the ELEMENT knows
 * which one is winning.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT RUNS IN DARK AS WELL AS LIGHT, because the app carries two token
 * systems (`--label`/`--bg`/`--bg-elevated` and `--k-ink`/`--k-bg`/`--k-surface`)
 * that are equal in light and divergent in dark. Every defect of that class this
 * project has shipped was invisible in light: a light-only check is measuring
 * agreement between the two systems, not correctness of either.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY CHECK PRINTS ITS DENOMINATOR. "All 6 selects share one appearance"
 * and "all 0 selects share one appearance" are the same sentence, and a checker
 * that says only OK cannot be caught doing nothing.
 *
 * Not part of `npm test` -- it needs a browser, and this repo has no
 * dependencies. See README.md in this directory for the sandboxed recipe.
