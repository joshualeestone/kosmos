 * conversation on this machine. So both seams are stubbed before the server is
 * required:
 *
 *   - the pane source, so the board is a fixture fleet and not the real one;
 *   - `chat`'s tmux runner, so a Send reaches this file and no further.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT REFUSES TO START UNSANDBOXED. The membership writes this screen
 * makes rewrite the instruction files agents boot from, so an unsandboxed run
 * does not litter — it changes how a working agent behaves at its next start.
