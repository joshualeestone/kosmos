/**
 * Every control a person can reach has a name a screen reader can say.
 *
 * 🛑 THE FAILURE THIS CATCHES IS SILENT AND LOOKS FINE. A button with an icon
 * and no accessible name renders perfectly and announces as "button". Mona Lisa
 * found one the night this was written: six agents behind on a project, six
 * buttons reading "Bring it up to date", and nothing to tell a screen-reader
 * user which was which. It was correct markup and a correct sentence, and it
 * was unusable by ear.
 *
 * 🔑 IT WALKS SURFACES, NOT THE PAGE. A one-off scan of the four tabs came back
 * clean and proved less than it looked: the create form, the two modals and the
 * project room are all controls a person reaches and none of them are on a
 * resting tab. What is checked is listed in SURFACES below, and what is NOT
 * checked is listed under it, because a sweep that does not say where it did
 * not look reads as a clean bill.
 *
 * ⚠️ NAME, NOT LABEL. The accessible name can come from `aria-label`,
 * `aria-labelledby`, the control's own text, a `<label for>`, an image's alt
 * or `title`. Checking only `aria-label` would fail every correctly-built
 * button in the product.
 *
 * Run against a sandboxed board (never the operator's real data):
 *
 *   AGENT_WORKFORCE_DATA=/tmp/a11y PORT=17370 node server.js &
 *   NODE_PATH="$HOME/work/pw-runtime/node_modules" \
 *     KOSMOS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:17370 node docs/browser-checks/named-controls.js
 *
 * ⚠️ HEADED by default, like its neighbours. `HEADED=0` on a machine with no
 * console session.
