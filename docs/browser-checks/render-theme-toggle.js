/**
 * The light and dark control, rendered (#284).
 *
 * 🔑 Josh, 2026-08-22: "I don't want auto. Let's take auto off of it so we have
 * just the sun and the moon", with the pack screenshot of gold marking the
 * active one, "the same height as the grid, list, and org chart viewers", and
 * "the light/dark mode is to the far right and the agent status is to the left
 * of it. Right now we're showing it in the reverse way."
 *
 * [Superseded in part by #2194, 2026-09-04: the board-view toggle was moved past
 * the light/dark switcher, so the switcher is no longer the far-right control.
 * Josh's 08-22 words are kept verbatim as the record. This check's own geometry
 * arm (the status stamp is to the LEFT of the switcher) is unaffected and still
 * holds; only the "far right" description above no longer matches the layout.]
 *
 * ⚠️ ALL FOUR OF THOSE ARE GEOMETRY OR PAINT, so they are asserted on a rendered
 * page rather than in the markup. The one that markup cannot answer at all is
 * the highlight: with `Auto` gone, nothing is stored until somebody picks, so
 * the lit half has to be READ from what the page is actually in.
 *
