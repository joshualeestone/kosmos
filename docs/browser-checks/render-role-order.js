/**
 * The three role options, in Josh's order, with the menu opening between the
 * second and the third -- and the keyboard behaviour that is now the browser's.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY A BROWSER AND NOT A SOURCE TEST. What this pins is that three radio
 * inputs form ONE group by sharing a name while a `<div>` sits between two of
 * them. That is a fact about the platform's grouping, not about our markup: a
 * source assertion could confirm the three `name="rmode"` attributes and say
 * nothing at all about whether arrowing moves between them or whether checking
 * the third clears the first.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT RUNS IN WEBKIT AS WELL AS CHROMIUM, which is not optional here.
 * Kosmos opens the DEFAULT browser, which on a stock Mac is Safari. The
 * selected-row styling is now `:has(input:checked)` -- if `:has` did not
 * resolve, every option would look unselected forever while the form worked
 * perfectly, and a Chromium-only run would report that as fine.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ASSERTS THE ROW IS PAINTED BEFORE IT ASSERTS WHERE THE ROW IS. A
 * hidden element reports a bottom of 0, which is above everything, so "the menu
 * is under its own option" is VACUOUSLY true of a menu that is not there. That
 * is not a hypothetical: it is how a sibling check in this directory passed
 * with its paint deleted, on 2026-08-22.
 *
 * Needs a sandbox with first run already complete -- see the README.
 *
 * Run: see the README in this directory.
