#
# Start one agent, and keep launchd from restarting it in a loop.
#
# ⚠️ ONE FILE, SHARED BY EVERY AGENT, and that is the whole point of it.
#
# This used to be generated per agent: each one got its own 151-line copy under
# its own folder. Every defect in it therefore shipped as many times as there
# were agents, and every FIX reached only the agents created afterwards — the
# ones already on the machine kept their copy of the bug forever. It also could
# not be reviewed once: it was reviewed per generation, which is how six
# separate defects got into it across one afternoon.
#
# Now it takes the agent as arguments and is installed once, so a change here
# reaches every agent the next time it starts.
#
# Usage, which is what the launchd job runs:
#
#   agent-supervisor.sh <session> <workdir> <runner-bin> <tmux-bin> [log] [model] [runner]
#
# ⚠️ THIS VECTOR IS A CONTRACT WITH EVERY AGENT THAT ALREADY EXISTS, and it is
# the one thing about this file that CANNOT be changed freely.
#
# The supervisor is refreshed whenever an agent is created, so a change here
# reaches agents made long ago. Their launchd jobs are NOT: each plist is
# written once, at creation, and never rewritten. So the script travels and the
# arguments do not.
#
# Which means: **a new argument must be optional and must have a default**, and
# the existing five must keep their positions and meanings. Adding a required
# `${6:?...}`, or reordering, silently bricks every pre-existing agent — bash
# exits at once, KeepAlive respawns it every thirty seconds forever, and the
# board shows the agent as simply down with nothing anywhere saying why.
#
# If a change ever genuinely needs to break the vector, it needs to rewrite the
# existing plists at the same time, and that is a migration rather than an edit.
#
# ⚠️ The NAME is not re-validated here, deliberately. `engine/create.js`
# validates it once, hard, before anything is written — the same name that
# becomes a directory, a service label and a tmux session — and a second, weaker
# copy of that rule here would be exactly the two-definitions-of-one-fact defect
# this codebase keeps paying for. The paths get a shape check there and nothing
# more, which is worth knowing if you run this by hand with your own.
#
# What this file must do instead, and does throughout, is never interpolate an
# argument into anything that reinterprets it: every use below is a quoted
# "$1"-style expansion passed as one argument to one command.

# ⚠️ TWO SPELLINGS OF THE SAME SESSION, and which commands take which was

#   list-panes                : accept "=name" (exact) -- USE IT. Their default
#                               resolution falls back to a PREFIX match, so

#                               samantha-discord. Measured, by killing one.
#   set-option, show-options  : REJECT "=name" outright ("no such session:
#                               =name"). They take the plain name.
#
# The two plain-name commands prefix-match too, but both run only when an exact
# session of this name is known to exist -- inside the loop that has-session
# guarded, or after new-session made it -- and tmux prefers an exact match over
# a prefix. Also measured.
