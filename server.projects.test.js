 * The projects routes, driven against the real server.
 *
 * A SEPARATE FILE from `server.test.js`, on purpose. The `restart` branch has
 * been parked for days on a merge of two versions of one test file whose blocks
 * had been restructured on both sides — four scripted approaches failed, and
 * the closest three-way still cut conflict boundaries through the middle of
 * test bodies. PR #28 adds 516 lines to `server.test.js`. This feature adds
 * none, so the union is a file list rather than a merge.
 *
 * ⚠️ SANDBOX ALL THREE ROOTS BEFORE ANY REQUIRE. The instruction files these
 * routes write are the ones live agents boot from: an unsandboxed run does not
 * litter, it changes how working agents behave the next time they start.
