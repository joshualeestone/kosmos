#   IF YOU ARE READING THIS IN YOUR TERMINAL, KOSMOS DID NOT INSTALL.
#
#   Nothing went wrong and nothing was broken. This is the installer's
#   own text, printed to your screen instead of being run.
#
#   You need the whole line, including the part at the end:
#
#       curl -fsSL https://installkosmos.com/setup | sh
#
#   Copy that, paste it into Terminal, and press Return.
#   ------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ⚠️ THE FIRST TWELVE LINES OF THIS FILE ARE WRITTEN FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT
# US, AND THEY EARNED THEIR PLACE. On 2026-08-22 the first person outside this
# team to try Kosmos ran `curl -fsSL .../setup` with no `| sh`. curl did as it
# was asked, printed 2,169 lines of this file to her screen, and exited 0. She
# reported to Josh that the product was broken, and she was being reasonable:
# the failure is silent, succeeds, and looks catastrophic.
#
# Everything below this banner is written for whoever maintains the installer.
# The top of the screen is the one moment we are guaranteed the attention of
# somebody who has just watched two thousand lines scroll past, and it used to
# be spent on /Applications icon staging -- true, careful, and useless to her.
# (Splinter's catch. The page it came from was fixed the same night so the
# command can no longer be half-selected; this is the belt for every other way
# a person can arrive holding half of it.)
#
# Kosmos installer. One line, no sudo, no password. Everything lives in your
# home folder except: the app icon, which goes to /Applications when this
# user can write there without a password (macOS admin accounts can), and
# into the Applications folder inside your home folder otherwise; the
# icon's one-line registration with macOS (so Spotlight knows it exists);
# and, on --uninstall, the launchd bookkeeping that removes agents'
# background jobs. In
# /Applications it only ever replaces a Kosmos icon it can prove it created
# itself (by the icon's own contents); its write check creates and removes
# one empty hidden folder there; and the icon is assembled in a hidden
# .Kosmos.app.stage.<pid> folder beside its spot and renamed into place,
# with the replaced icon renamed aside as .Kosmos.app.old.<pid> until the
# swap completes (an interrupted run can leave either hidden folder
# behind; --uninstall sweeps both when it can prove they are this
# install's own, and names anything it leaves). macOS may show its own one-time
# "Terminal wants to manage apps" dialog for the icon step. It never
# touches any other app. A fresh
# install that confirms its own board is running finishes by opening your
# browser at the Kosmos dashboard; updates never do, and KOSMOS_NO_OPEN=1
# turns it off.
#
# ⚠️ THE SHEBANG SAYS sh BECAUSE THE PAGE SAYS sh. This file's contract is
# the interpreter the marketing line actually invokes: macOS /bin/sh, which
# is bash 3.2 in POSIX mode (the Darwin gate below runs before anything
# non-POSIX, so a Linux dash never gets past the first sentence). `local`
# and `set -o pipefail` are safe under macOS sh specifically, and that is
# the only sh this file supports.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://installkosmos.com/setup | sh
#
# ⚠️ WHO THIS IS FOR, because it governs every decision below. The person running
# this has been handed a line to paste by someone they trust, in a room, and has
# possibly never opened Terminal before. They are not debugging. If something
# goes wrong they will not read a stack trace, they will conclude the product is
# broken and stop. So:
#
#   - EVERY step prints what it is doing BEFORE it does it. A silent install is
#     the documented disqualifying failure (launch decision, 2026-08-11: a
#     silent install disqualifies the product): a blank terminal
#     for several minutes reads as broken, and the person quits before it
#     finishes. Measured on a competitor the same week this was written: ten
#     minutes of no output at all while it downloaded a database.
#   - Every failure prints what to do next, in a sentence, not an error code.
#   - Nothing needs sudo. Nothing is written outside $HOME except: the app
#     icon (and the write probe that decides where it can go), which uses
#     /Applications only when this user can already write there without a
#     password; the icon's one-line registration with macOS
#     (LaunchServices, so Spotlight knows it exists); and, on --uninstall,
#     the launchd enable/bootout that removes agents' background jobs. The
#     header sentence above lists the same three exceptions; when one
#     list changes the other must, because this file is served verbatim at
#     https://installkosmos.com/setup and these sentences are what a cautious
#     person reads before piping it into sh.
#   - Running it twice is safe and says so.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT MUST BE REVERSIBLE. `--uninstall` genuinely returns the machine to
# before. That is not politeness: the first run on a never-touched Mac is the
# most valuable test this project will ever get, and it is worth exactly once
# unless we can put the machine back. One stated bound: anything the
# uninstall cannot PROVE this installer created is left alone and named,
# never deleted; on the rare machine where that leaves something behind,
# the sentence says what it is.

# ⚠️ THE macOS CHECK RUNS BEFORE ANY set OPTION. `set -o pipefail` is not
# POSIX; on a Linux dash the old order died with a raw shell error before
# reaching the friendly "Kosmos runs on macOS" sentence below.

# ⚠️ Overridable for the same reason the sources are: the sandboxed test of
# this installer must not write an app icon into the real Applications
# folders of the machine it runs on. Everything this script writes goes
# under a root the test can point somewhere disposable. When the override is
# set it is used VERBATIM -- no probing, no fallback -- so a sandbox stays a
# sandbox.
#
# ⚠️ WITHOUT the override, the icon goes to /Applications when this user can
# write there without a password, and only otherwise to ~/Applications.
# Measured on the first real clean-machine run (2026-08-13): the icon went
# to ~/Applications, the tester opened Finder's Applications (which shows
# /Applications), and concluded it "did not put it in my applications". For
# this installer's audience, an app that is not where people look does not
# exist. macOS gives admin users group write on /Applications, so the common
# case needs no password; the probe is an actual mkdir, not `-w`, because
# ACLs can make `-w` lie in both directions.
# ⚠️ THE ownership predicate, defined ONCE. Every rm -rf and every claim
# in this file is gated by this exact function; it was previously
# hand-assembled at a dozen sites in four different guard combinations,
# and every gap a review found was a site missing one guard the others
# had. It returns 0 only for a REAL directory bundle -- no symlink at
# the root, at Contents, at MacOS, or at the launcher leaf, because a
# link at any level would make the content check read a file the bundle
# does not own -- whose launcher carries this install's anchored token
# (`:-<home>}"`, closing brace and quote included, so prefix-related
# homes cannot cross-match). /usr/bin/grep by absolute path: this answer
# decides where rm -rf points, so it must not be answerable by whatever

# 4317 is the OpenTelemetry OTLP/gRPC default and 4318 its HTTP sibling, so the
# people most likely to collide with Kosmos were the people already running
# agents -- exactly this product's audience. Josh picked 16180 (the golden
# ratio) and it checks out: nothing in the service registry, nothing clustered
# near it, and it is memorable enough to type.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN 49152-65535, which was the tempting answer
# because no software ships a default there. MEASURED on macOS:
#     net.inet.ip.portrange.first: 49152
#     net.inet.ip.portrange.last:  65535
# That range IS the ephemeral pool the kernel hands out for outgoing
# connections, so a fixed listener in it would collide occasionally, randomly,
# and only sometimes -- an intermittent failure nobody can reproduce, which is
# worse than the deterministic one it replaced. The registered range is the
# quiet, stable part and that is where this sits.

  # all (19 of the 22 here are `false`, which is Claude Code's default rather
  # than an answer). Second, `_agents_stopped`: the paragraph above deliberately
  # says nothing about agents on a machine that had none, and this block was

  # being one. Now the installer installs it, using Anthropic's own
  # installer into the exact path Kosmos launches from, and SAYS SO FIRST:
  # nothing is installed beyond what this sentence names. Neutral -- no
  # engine until first-run picks a provider -- remains the destination and
  # stacks on top of this unchanged.

# ⚠️ THE INSTALLER NEVER MENTIONS A PROVIDER BY NAME, AND THAT IS A RULE RATHER

#
# An earlier version of this file checked for Claude Code here and reported on
# it. Harmless today, when Claude is the only option, and a trap the moment there
# is a second one: the assumption spreads, and adding OpenAI then means either
# bloating this one line toward 700MB or bolting on a separate mechanism.
#
# So this script installs the PLATFORM: a runtime, a terminal multiplexer, and
# Kosmos. **Choosing a provider inside the app is what installs that provider**,
# which is also the click that signs you into it.
#
# Three things that gets us:
#   1. The terminal step drops to ~130MB instead of ~400MB. In a room of thirty
#      people watching a black screen, that difference is the whole experience.
#   2. The large download happens inside our UI, where a real progress bar can
#      live, instead of in a terminal where silence reads as a hang.
#   3. Nobody downloads a provider they will never use.
#
# ⚠️ What it costs, so nobody is surprised: the user is NOT finished when this
# script finishes. The provider screen has to survive being quit and resumed
# mid-download, because somebody will close the laptop.

# version until a reboot. Stopping first also closes the window where the
# live server's web/index.html is deleted out from under it mid-install.
# (The board was already paused above, before the tmux swap; a refused
# pause has already refused the whole update in a sentence.)

# technical-looking 127.0.0.1:4317 is super scary looking for a non-technical
# person... Nobody will ever come back to this after the install essentially."
# He is right, and it would have been the quiet reason the product got installed
# once and never opened again.
#
# ⚠️ AND THIS DOES NOT REOPEN THE SETTLED "NO .app" DECISION. The launch
# decision of 2026-08-11 ruled out a DOWNLOADABLE app, because an unsigned app that arrives from the
# internet carries a quarantine attribute and Gatekeeper shows the "unidentified
# developer" block, which needs an Apple developer account to clear.
#
# An app BUILT HERE is never downloaded, so it is never quarantined, so
# Gatekeeper never runs. MEASURED: a locally-created .app has no extended
# attributes at all and macOS reports it as a proper application bundle. We still
# ship one terminal line. That line just leaves an icon behind.
# ⚠️ STAGED, LIKE EVERY OTHER SWAP IN THIS FILE. The bundle is built complete
# in a hidden sibling and renamed into place, because a build that dies
# between mkdir and the launcher write used to leave a launcher-less husk at
# the real path -- which every later run's ownership check read as foreign
# (divert forever) and which --uninstall refused to touch for the same

# ---- the permission acceptance (#46, Josh's ruling 2026-08-17) --------------
# Agents run Claude Code with permission prompts skipped; the FIRST such run
# on a machine shows Claude Code's own full-screen acceptance wall, and an
# agent stuck at it looks exactly like an agent thinking (Josh met this on a
# clean Mac: his first message sat against a wall of warning text). His
# ruling, verbatim intent: no extra click, no extra screen -- "when they're
# installing it they're giving us permission to do all of those things." So
# the install records the acceptance the wall exists to collect.
#
# ⚠️ The key is skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt in ~/.claude/settings.json.
# The fleet bulletin's trap: defaultMode alone is NOT enough; only this key
# stops the wall. MERGE, never clobber -- the file may carry a person's real
# Claude Code settings, and an installer that eats somebody's config to set
# one flag is worse than the wall. The merge runs on the Node runtime THIS
# INSTALL just verified runnable -- /usr/bin/python3 is a Command Line Tools
# shim, and its first invocation on a clean Mac can pop Apple's developer-
# tools dialog mid-install, the exact machine this block exists for. If the
# file exists but cannot be parsed as JSON (or is not an object), LEAVE IT
# ALONE and say so (fail-soft: the wall appearing later is recoverable; a
# clobbered config is not) -- one Enter in the agent's session clears it,
# per docs/clean-machine-retest.md. The symlink, mode, and zero-byte edges
# are each pinned by tools/test-permission-acceptance.sh.

# of scraping its pane (#526 shipped the verb; this gives it a mouth on every
# machine). ONE merge implementation does all the wiring -- engine/reporthook
# -- called here for the default ~/.claude and every existing account dir,
# and by accounts.prepare for every account born later. Updates re-run this
# script, so machines that predate the hook pick it up on their next update.
# Same fail-soft posture as the permission block above: a machine that could
# not be wired still installs, and the board falls back to reading screens,
# which is the pre-hook world rather than a corruption.
# ⚠️ The heredoc marker here must NOT be the one the permission block above

# 🛑 THE BOARD WAS THE ONE PIECE WITH NO LOGIN JOB, and every agent had one.
# `kosmos start` runs the server under `nohup`, which survives the terminal that
# launched it and nothing else: a reboot ends it, and NOTHING anywhere started
# it again. Measured on Josh's machine on 2026-08-22, and the reason it read as
# total failure rather than as one dead process is that the browser still had
# the page cached — so every panel rendered and every panel said "we could not
# check this computer". The product looked broken in six places at once because
# the one thing that answers questions was not running.
#
# ⚠️ THIS FLEET'S OWN MAC HAD A HAND-WRITTEN com.kosmos.board.plist since
# 10 August, so the dev board came back after every reboot and a real install
# never did. We were configured out of our own bug, which is why nobody hit it
# for eleven days. Two things that file learned the hard way are carried into
# the template below rather than rediscovered: launchd sets neither PATH nor
# LANG, and without LANG tmux sanitises its format output so every agent comes
# back named `angel-discord_0.0_2.1.223_…` with the tab separators replaced.
#
# ⚠️ RunAtLoad AND NO KeepAlive, deliberately, and this is the one decision here
# worth arguing with. `kosmos start` daemonises and exits, so it is a "run this
# at login" job rather than a supervised process. KeepAlive would relaunch it
# the moment it returned — a loop — and the alternative shape (launchd owns the
# node process directly) breaks `kosmos stop`, which must keep meaning stopped,
# and the updater's stop/start with it. Crash supervision is a real thing to
# want and it needs `kosmos` to grow a foreground mode; it is not this change.

# exports it globally because a test that steals the operator's browser is
# a test nobody runs twice. KOSMOS_OPEN_CMD exists ONLY so the harness can
# substitute a recording stub and assert both legs -- a hardcoded
# /usr/bin/open made this block the one new behavior the suite could not
# see at all. Unguarded by choice, unlike KOSMOS_HOME and KOSMOS_PORT:
# it is never baked into anything and anyone who can set it can already

# The sandbox overrides also suppress the open (belt to KOSMOS_NO_OPEN's
# braces): either override set means a harness, and a harness must not
# depend solely on remembering the other knob. KOSMOS_SYS_APP_DIR gets
