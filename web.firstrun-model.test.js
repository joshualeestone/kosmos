/**
 * The first-run model step shows one choosable model at full weight and the
 * rest behind a disclosure (#262).
 *
 * 🛑 THE STEP RENDERED 1003px AND ITS CONTINUE SAT BELOW THE FOLD at 950, 800
 * and 700. The overlay scrolls, so nothing was clipped and nothing was
 * unreachable; what a person met was a screen that looked complete with its
 * only way forward two to three hundred pixels under the edge.
 *
 * 🔑 THE FIX IS ABOUT WEIGHT AND THE OVERFLOW IS A CONSEQUENCE. The step asks
 * somebody to choose a model and there is exactly ONE choosable model. Five
 * rows nobody can select are a roadmap, and at full weight above an invisible
 * Continue they invert the priority: the thing you cannot do is visible and the
 * thing you must do is not.
 *
 * 📌 AND IT IS THE TREATMENT THE CREATE FORM ALREADY USES for the same five, so
 * a person now meets one list twice rather than two lists that look different.
 * Measured after the change: 616px, primary above the fold at all three
 * heights.
 *
 * Ruled by Mona Lisa, who measured the recovery before ruling it.
