/**
 * Delete your history: the record of what your agents have SAID and REPORTED.
 *
 * 🛑 THIS IS THE ONE CONTROL IN KOSMOS THAT TAKES SOMETHING AWAY WITH NO UNDO,
 * so the scope is named exhaustively here and nowhere else, and the screen
 * reads it from this module rather than describing it in its own words. Two
 * directories, both entirely ours:
 *
 *   chats/        every conversation -- the direct threads and the project rooms
 *   commitments/  what each agent last reported it was holding
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE LIST OF THINGS IT DOES NOT TOUCH IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF, because
 * a person deleting "history" cannot be expected to guess where the line is:
 *
 *   projects.json          projects, their members, and their tasks
 *   profiles/ avatars/     who an agent IS, which is not something it has done
 *   the worker folders     instructions, and the files agents made
 *   ~/.claude/projects/    the TRANSCRIPTS, which are Claude Code's and are
 *                          shared across accounts. Deleting those is the exact
 *                          amnesia the account move refuses to cause, and it
 *                          would be Kosmos destroying another tool's data.
 *
 * 🔑 IT CAN ONLY EVER REMOVE THOSE TWO NAMES. `rm -rf` on a computed path is
 * how a delete feature becomes an incident: the paths are joined from a fixed
 * list here, checked to be inside the data root, and nothing else is reachable
 * from any caller. There is no argument that widens it.
