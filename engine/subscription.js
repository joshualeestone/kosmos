/**
 * Is a Claude subscription connected on this machine?
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS THE FIRST QUESTION FIRST RUN ASKS, AND THE ONE MOST LIKELY TO BE
 * ANSWERED WRONG.
 *
 * The obvious field is `hasAvailableSubscription`. It is a trap. Measured on
 * this machine, on a working Claude Max 20x account, right now:
 *
 *     hasAvailableSubscription   false      <-- the obvious check
 *     organizationType           claude_max
 *     billingType                stripe_subscription
 *     organizationRateLimitTier  default_claude_max_20x
 *
 * So a naive check tells a PAYING CUSTOMER they are not subscribed, on the
 * screen that decides whether they keep the product. There is no recovering
 * from that: they either go and buy a second subscription or they close it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND `subscriptionType` APPEARS TWICE with different values in some
 * configs — the same field name in two places, one of them `null`. Any check
 * has to say WHICH one it read. This module reads neither.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE THIS MODULE IS BUILT ON, and it is this codebase's rule applied
 * to the highest-stakes screen: **there are three answers, not two.** Connected,
 * not connected, and *we cannot tell* — and "we cannot tell" must never be
 * rendered as "not connected", because the cost of those two mistakes is wildly
 * asymmetric. Telling somebody who has no subscription that we are unsure costs
 * them one extra click. Telling somebody who pays that they do not pay loses
 * them.

/* ---- the cached read, for the status tick -------------------------------
   ⚠️ THIS EXISTS FOR A MEASURED REASON, NOT A SUSPECTED ONE. `check()` parses
   the Claude config, which is 95,152 bytes on the machine this was written on,
   and the board asks for status every 5 seconds. That is twelve 95KB parses a
   minute, forever, to answer a question whose answer changes when somebody logs
   in or out. The README calls that class of work "the difference between a page
   that idles cool and one that spins a fan".

   ⚠️ AND THIS IS THE LEAST TRUSTWORTHY CODE IN THE FEATURE, so read its failure
   mode before changing it. A stale cache here does not merely serve an old
   number: it would keep reporting `connected` AFTER the connection broke, which
   is precisely the case this whole feature was built to catch. The cache lying
   is worse than the cache not existing.

   So the key is deliberately paranoid. It is not just mtime:

     - `mtimeMs` catches an edit,
     - `size` catches an edit that somehow lands on the same millisecond,
     - `ino` catches an ATOMIC REPLACE, which is how a lot of tools write config
       (write a temp file, rename over the target). That leaves mtime and size
       plausible-looking on a brand new file, and the inode is what gives it
       away.

   A failed stat is a KEY, not an error. `missing:ENOENT` is a different key
   from any real file, so a deleted config invalidates rather than sticking on
   the last good answer. Same for a permissions change. That is the property
   that stops this from lying.

   Known and accepted: a filesystem with coarse mtime granularity could hide an
   edit that also preserved size AND inode. Rewriting a JSON config in place,
   within one mtime tick, to the same byte length, is not a thing that happens
   to this file. Documented rather than defended against. */
