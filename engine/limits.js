/**
 * The conversation limit, the person's control (2026-08-18 in-channel:
 * Josh's shape, Mona Lisa's copy and split, Splinter's convergence
 * catch).
 *
 * The model: the counter ALWAYS tells the person; this setting decides
 * only whether Kosmos also STOPS the conversation. Telling is not
 * configurable -- the valve's original job was convergence, cost was
 * borrowed onto it, and "two of your agents are circling" is true and
 * useful on a free model with nothing to bill.
 *
 * The dial is PER CONVERSATION, not global: each PAIR gets `perHour`
 * exchanges an hour; each ROOM gets four times that in arrivals (the
 * recorded 4x allowance: the room is the visible collaboration
 * surface). The default equals the previously hard-coded rate exactly,
 * so shipping this On changes nothing for existing fleets.
 *
 * ⚠️ An unreadable or malformed file fails toward ON at the default:
 * between "we could not read your setting so we spent your money" and
 * "we could not read your setting so we kept the brake on", the
 * bounded direction is the safe one, and the screens read the same
 * verdict so the card can say the file could not be read.
