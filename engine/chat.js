/**
 * Talking to ONE agent, about ONE project.
 *
 * The gap this closes: a card could say an agent is asking you something, and
 * there was nowhere to see the question or answer it. The board could observe
 * an agent and could not reach one.
 *
 * ⚠️ This paragraph used to be framed as a QUOTATION of the person who reported
 * the gap, around a card sentence the copy sweep then rewrote. An edited
 * quotation is not a quotation, so the frame went rather than the words.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS MODULE MAY CLAIM, and the fourth row is the one that is never
 * ours. `engine/projects.js` has the same table for membership; this is the
 * same discipline pointed at a keystroke:
 *
 * | Claim | | |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | we put this text into that pane | ✅ | tmux took it and said so |
 * | this is what that pane shows right now | ✅ | we captured it a moment ago |
 * | we could not deliver, and why | ✅ | the failure is ours to report |
 * | we typed it and cannot tell whether it landed | ✅ | our own blind spot, stated |
 * | what the pane was doing when we typed | ✅ | the board's own verdict, at that moment |
 * | the agent **read** it, received it, or will act on it | ❌ | never |
 *
 * The fourth is false in three separate ways, which is why it gets a paragraph
 * rather than a footnote. `send-keys` reaches a terminal, not a program's
 * understanding: the composer may be mid-render, the agent may be busy for
 * minutes, and a Claude that is thinking does not consume its input box the
 * moment text lands in it. So every sentence this module produces is about the
 * KEYSTROKE, and the UI that renders it says "placed into casey's session just
 * now", never "casey received it".
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE PANE IS SHOWN, NEVER PARSED. There is no bubble-maker here. A
 * parser that guesses which lines of a TUI are "the agent talking" puts words
 * in the agent's mouth the first time it guesses wrong, and it will guess wrong
 * — Claude Code redraws, wraps, animates, and prints tool output that looks
 * exactly like prose. So the agent's side of this screen is a VIEWPORT: the
 * literal tail of what the terminal is displaying, labelled as that.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE THIS WAS WRITTEN (2026-08-13, tmux 3.6a, this
 * machine — the same discipline connect.js's fixtures are held to):
 *
 *   - `send-keys -t '=<session>:<window>.<pane>' -l -- <text>` places the text
 *     literally, INCLUDING a leading `-` (probed with `-echo dashy-probe-text`,
 *     which landed verbatim in the composer). `-l` sends literal characters
 *     rather than key names, and `--` ends option parsing.
 *   - A second, separate `send-keys -t <same> Enter` submits it. The two are
 *     never one call: `-l` would type the word "Enter".
 *   - `capture-pane -p -J -t '=<session>:<window>.<pane>'` reads that pane back.
 *   - The `=` exact-match prefix DOES defeat prefix matching on a pane target:
 *     with the session killed and a `kchatprobe2` still alive, the same command
 *     answered `can't find session: kchatprobe` rather than landing on the
 *     lookalike. That refusal is the whole reason every target here is built
 *     with `=`.

 * Where a send got to. THREE values, and the third is the one that matters.
 *
 * ⚠️ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS BLOCK HAD TWO, and said so proudly: "unlike a
 * status read there is no 'we did not look' — a send either happened or it did
 * not". That is wrong about the only part of this module that touches another
 * program. We drive tmux, and tmux can take a keystroke and then fail to tell
 * us so: a timed-out call may have delivered, and an Enter we could not send
 * leaves the person's words sitting in a live composer.
 *
 * With two states those cases render as failure — and the person does the
 * obvious thing, which is send it again. Now the agent has the message twice,
 * and on the screen this feature exists for (a permission prompt) the second
 * copy answers a question the first one already answered. **The verdict has to
 * make re-sending feel unnecessary exactly when it is**, which is a thing only
 * a third state can say.
 *
 * The line between them is not "how bad it was". It is one checkable fact:
 *
 *   COULD_NOT    — NOTHING of the person's text reached the pane. Re-sending is
 *                  safe, and is what they should do.
 *   UNCONFIRMED  — something may have. Re-sending may duplicate it. Look at the
 *                  screen, which is on this very page, before deciding.
 *   PLACED       — tmux took the text and the Enter, and said so.

 *   typed `wait;;`                    → pane `wait;`             (exactly one eaten)
 *   typed `const a = 1; const b = 2`  → unchanged  (a middle `;` is safe)
 *   typed `const total = 0; `         → unchanged  (a trailing SPACE saves it)

 *   typed `foo\;`                     → pane `foo;`  (the `\` escapes the `;`: one pair, one semicolon)
 *   typed `foo\\;` (2 backslashes)    → pane `foo\;` (so the ESCAPED form round-trips exactly)
 *
 * The last two rows settle the input class this function's own design lives
 * on (measured 2026-08-14, same scratch-session instrument): a message
 *   ending `\;` wires to `…\\;` and arrives as `…\;`, the person's text
 * exactly. tmux's splitter consumes one backslash to escape the final
 * semicolon and nothing else; it does not treat `\\` as a general escape
 * that would leave a bare separator behind.
 *
 * Two different harms. The first is quiet: the text delivered is not the text
 * we checked, recorded and rendered, and the verdict still says `placed` — the
 * screen shows the person a semicolon their agent never received. The second is
 * not quiet at all: a message of exactly `;` types NOTHING, and the separate
 * Enter still fires, so a bare submit lands in a live composer. On the
 * permission prompt this whole feature exists for, a bare submit takes the
 * highlighted default. We would have reported that as `placed`.
 *
 * Escaping the trailing one as `\;` makes the parser hand it back as a literal.
 * Measured to round-trip all eight cases above, including `wait;;` (sent as
 * `wait;\;`) and a message ending in a backslash, which is untouched.
 *
 * ⚠️ APPLIED AT THE SEND AND NOWHERE ELSE. `cleanMessage` is what gets checked,
 * recorded and shown, and it must stay the person's own text — an escape that
 * leaked into the record would put a backslash in their history and in the

 *
 * ⚠️ THE STATE IS THE BOARD'S, not a second reading. It comes off the roster
 * card the send was authorised against — the same `classify` verdict the agent's
 * own card shows — so the thread and the card cannot disagree about what an
 * agent was doing. And it is a claim about WHEN THIS WAS SENT, not about now:
 * the roster is one observation, taken at the start of the request, and the

 * The part of the screen that made the board say "Needs you".

 * answer to one question, this codebase's worst habit, and it would drift the
 * first time a marker is added there. So this function SHARES the markers with
 * the card that sent the person here.
 *
 * ⚠️ That is not the same as the two agreeing, and an earlier version of this
 * paragraph claimed it was. The two reads differ in THREE ways, not one, and
 * only the first is about timing:
 *
 *   MOMENT — the card comes from the roster snapshot at the top of the request;
 *            this runs on a capture taken after it, and a TUI redraws.
 *   FLAGS  — `status.capturePane` does NOT pass `-J`; `viewport` does. `-J`
 *            joins a wrapped line back together, so a marker split across the
 *            pane's right edge is one line here and two there. The board can
 *            see a question this misses, and the reverse.
 *   DEPTH  — the board asks for 40 lines of scrollback and `classify` then
 *            reads only the LAST 25 of what came back; this asks for 60 and
 *            scans all of it. A question that has scrolled past those last 25
 *            lines is invisible to the card while still being findable here.
 *            (⚠️ MEASURED: `-S -N` returns N lines of scrollback PLUS the
 *            pane height — on a 20-row pane, `-S -40` came back with 60 lines
 *            and `-S -60` with 80. So neither number is the size of what is
 *            returned, and an earlier version of this note read as though it
 *            were. The 25-line window is the part that actually bounds what
 *            the card can see.)
 *
 * All three gaps are real and reachable, which is exactly why the route carries
 * `questionBecause` — a sentence for the case where the two reads disagree,
 * instead of a silence that would render as no question at all under a card
 * saying there is one.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS STILL NOT A PARSER. It returns a SLICE of the same pane text,
 * from a few lines above the matching line to the end. It does not extract "the
 * question", name the options, or reword anything: the person reads the
 * terminal, we only scroll it to the right place.

 * parse — it scrolls the terminal to the right place and lets the person read
 * it. This goes one step further because the pack draws BUTTONS, and a button
 * carrying the wrong option's words sends an answer the person did not give.
 * When anything is off, it returns null and the screen falls back to the
 * question as it stands today. NEVER GUESS: an unparsed menu costs a person one
 * line of typing; a mis-parsed one answers for them.
 *
 * Confident means ALL of: the numbers run 1..n with no gap and no repeat; there
 * are between 2 and 9 of them; they are CONSECUTIVE lines of the capture; and
 * one of them carries the selection marker the TUI draws.
 *
 * WARNING: THE LAST TWO RULES ARE WHAT SEPARATE A MENU FROM PROSE, and without
 * them this function was confidently wrong on ordinary agent output. Measured
 * against the shipped version:
 *
 *   '1. Do X' + forty lines of anything + '2. Do Y'   -> a two-button menu
 *   'Would you like to review the plan?
 *     1. Delete the old build folder
 *     2. Rebuild from scratch'                        -> a two-button menu
 *
 * The second is the dangerous one: `Would you like to` is itself a
 * NEEDS_YOU_MARKER (engine/status.js), so `asking` is true for exactly that
 * shape, and the page would have drawn a button that types `1` into a live
 * pane and recorded that the person chose "Delete the old build folder".
 *
 * ADJACENCY says the lines belong to one list rather than being scattered
 * through a paragraph. THE MARKER says a TUI drew it: every real menu this
 * product meets highlights one row, and prose does not contain that glyph.
 * Both refusals land on state 5, which is the screen this page shows today.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE REPEAT RULE IS DOING REAL WORK. A pane accumulates, so an ALREADY
 * ANSWERED menu can still be on screen above the live one — `questionIn` takes
 * the last marker but its run-up slice can reach back over the earlier one.
 * That reads as 1,2,1,2, which fails contiguity, which lands on state 5. The
 * screen showing no buttons over a real menu is a small loss; buttons built
 * from a menu that was answered ten minutes ago is a wrong answer sent
 * confidently.
 *
 * The frame is stripped from BOTH ends before matching. Claude draws its
 * prompts inside a box on some versions and bare on others (the captures in
 * `engine/connect.test.js` are bare, taken from a real v2.1.229), and a leading
 * `│` would make every option line invisible to a pattern anchored at the
 * number.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY THE BOX-DRAWING `│` IS FRAME, at either end. An earlier version also
 * took an ASCII `|` off the LEFT and not the right, which is one end believing
 * in ASCII frames while the other does not: an ASCII-framed menu then parsed
 * with the padding and the closing pipe inside every label. Nothing this
 * product meets draws boxes in ASCII, so such a menu now simply refuses, which
 * is the safe end of that choice. And `2. use a pipe |` keeps its final
 * character, which the verbatim rule two lines down requires.
 *
 * Labels ride VERBATIM, which is the pack's rule: a button carries the option's
 * own words, not our summary of them.
