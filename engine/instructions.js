 * is. Today those files exist and are effectively invisible: they live on the

 * Editing it does not change a running agent -- only a restart re-reads it

 * is asserting something untrue: the agent is still running on what it read at
 * boot.
 *
 * A toast on save does not fix that. It is gone the moment you navigate away,
 * and it says nothing when the file is edited outside the app. So staleness is
 * derived as a STATE, from the file's modification time against the session's

 *   1. tmux's own `session_created`. A reading of when this session began,

 *   2. the transcript for THIS session id, when tmux cannot be reached. Its
 *      birth time was checked against the first entry's timestamp and matches.
 *      The folder fallback is deliberately not used here: see
 *      `transcriptForSession`.
 *   3. nothing, which is `unknown` -- "we cannot tell when this agent last
 *      started" -- and never "not stale".
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY NOT A RECORD OF OUR OWN. Kosmos knows when IT restarted an agent, and
 * that was the obvious third source. It is wrong in the dangerous direction:
 * launchd also restarts agents, at every login, and Kosmos never sees those --
 * so the record would be older than the truth and would produce exactly the

/**
 * Make an agent's own instructions agree with the name Kosmos shows.
 *
 * 🛑 JOSH RENAMED AN AGENT BOB TO SCARLET AND IT STILL THOUGHT IT WAS BOB
 * (2026-08-22). The name lives in two places: Kosmos's record, which the board
 * and every screen read, and the sentence at the top of the agent's own
 * instruction file, which is the only one the AGENT ever sees. Renaming through
 * the profile route moved the first and left the second, so every screen agreed
 * on Scarlet while Scarlet introduced herself as Bob.
 *
 * 🔑 IT EDITS ONE LINE AND GOES THROUGH `write`, not `writeFileSync`. The file
 * may be somebody's own, in their own folder, written before Kosmos existed --
 * a connected agent's instructions are not ours to reformat. Going through the
 * write path also means a concurrent edit CONFLICTS rather than being clobbered,
 * which a hand-rolled write here would not.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER ADDS A LINE THAT WAS NOT THERE. An instruction file that does not
 * introduce its agent by name is not broken, and inserting a sentence into
 * somebody's file to fix a disagreement it does not have is a bigger act than
 * the one being asked for. It reports that it changed nothing and why.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT NEVER THROWS AT THE CALLER. The rename it follows has already been
 * recorded; a failure here is a stale sentence in a file, not a failed rename,
 * and reporting it as one would tell somebody their rename did not work when it
 * did. Every arm answers a shape.
