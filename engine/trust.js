/**
 * Answer Claude Code's trust-this-folder question for a workspace Kosmos
 * itself just made.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE PROMPT, IT IS WHAT THE PROMPT COSTS US. Every new
 * agent stopped on it before its person had touched anything, so the card said
 * `Needs you` at birth. If EVERY new agent needs you, the badge stops
 * separating an agent that genuinely needs an answer from one that was merely
 * born, and that is the same failure as a success message that says everyone
 * received it: a true signal made useless by firing when nothing is wrong.
 * (Splinter's framing, #164.)
 *
 * 🔑 AND THE FOLDER IS OURS. Kosmos creates `~/work/workers/<name>`, writes the
 * agent's instructions into it, and then asks the person to vouch for it. There
 * is nothing for them to review that we did not put there a second earlier.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL'S CONFIG FILE, so every rule below is about touching
 * as little of it as possible. The write itself is not a guess: Claude Code
 * prints this remedy in its own words when it refuses an untrusted workspace —
 *
 *     this workspace has not been trusted. Run Claude Code interactively here
 *     once and accept the trust dialog, or set
 *     projects[<path>].hasTrustDialogAccepted: true in <config>
 *
 * — so the key, the location and the value are the ones the tool documents,
 * verified in the shipped 2.1.238 binary rather than remembered. It is still
 * treated as fragile: nothing here throws, and every refusal leaves the file
 * exactly as it was, which returns the person to today's behaviour.

/**
 * Take back the trust we wrote, for a folder that is being rolled back.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT EXISTS BECAUSE OF A SENTENCE. When `bootstrap` fails, creation tells
 * the person "we have taken it back off your computer rather than leave
 * something half installed" — and without this, a `projects[…]` entry for a
 * folder that no longer exists stays in another tool's config forever, which
 * makes that sentence false in exactly the case that produces it.
 *
 * 🛑 IT REMOVES THE KEY, NOT THE ENTRY, and the difference is somebody's data.
 * `trustFolder` reports `already: false` when it SET THE KEY — which is not the
 * same as having created the entry. A person can have a `projects[…]` entry for
 * that exact path carrying their allowedTools, their MCP servers and their
 * history, with no trust key in it. A version of this that deleted the entry
 * took all of that with it, on a path whose whole job is putting things back.
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT SHAPE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OBSERVED, and an earlier version of this
 * comment cited "93 dead entries measured on this machine" as evidence for it.
 * Those 93 were THIS BRANCH'S OWN DAMAGE — an unsandboxed suite writing temp
 * directories into the real config — so a bug of mine was being quoted back as
 * independent measurement. Measured properly: 0 of 22 entries lack the key. The
 * merge is still right, because the cost of being wrong about it is somebody's
 * settings. The number is what did not measure what it claimed.
 *
 * ⚠️ So: delete the key, and drop the entry only if nothing else is left in it.
 * That restores the exact state from before `trustFolder` ran, in both cases,
 * without needing to be told which case it was.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT CALLED ON AN ORDINARY REMOVAL, deliberately. Removing an
 * agent deletes its folder, which leaves an entry for a path that is gone — the
 * same litter this exists to avoid. But at that moment we cannot tell an entry
 * we wrote from one the person made themselves, and deleting their decision is
 * the harm every guard in this file is pointed at. The rollback below is
 * different only because we wrote that key seconds earlier and know it.
 * Recorded as a card rather than guessed at here.
 *
 * Same shape, same refusals, same fail-soft contract as `trustFolder`.
