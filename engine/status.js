/**
 * Is this line actually a pane, or something we cannot read?
 *
 * ⚠️ `PANE_FORMAT` is TAB-separated, and when the separator is absent every
 * field but the first is missing — so the whole line landed in `session` and
 * the rest defaulted, producing a syntactically valid agent whose name was the
 * entire raw line and whose target was `<whole line>:undefined`.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It happened on this machine: without a UTF-8
 * locale, **tmux sanitises its own format output** and replaces the tabs with
 * underscores (bisected: `PATH` alone gives mangled output, `PATH`+`LANG`
 * gives correct). The board then showed thirteen agents named
 * `angel-discord_0.0_2.1.223_0__ …` — populated, confident, and wrong, with
 * those entries carrying a name, a rank and a target into everything
 * downstream, where `safeKey` would happily sanitise one into a collision with
 * a real agent's key.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE IS "IS THE SESSION A FIELD", NOT "ARE ALL THE FIELDS THERE", and
 * the difference is a decision, not an oversight.
 *
 * Requiring every column would also reject a TRUNCATED line — and this module
 * deliberately keeps those. A short line still names a session we can identify,
 * and the missing fields default to the UNSAFE answer (`inMode` defaults to in
 * copy-mode, a missing `command` classifies `unknown` rather than `stopped`),
 * which is handled and tested. Dropping them would hide a running agent from
 * the board, which is the same class of harm as showing a garbage one, pointed
 * the other way.
 *
 * What makes the mangled line different is that NOTHING about it can be
 * identified: with no separator at all, `session` is the whole line, so there is
 * no agent to be conservative about.
 *
 * ⚠️ "A separator somewhere" is NOT enough, and the first version of this rule
 * was exactly that. `title` is the one field that can itself contain a tab (see
 * the format note above, and the test for tab-carrying titles), so a mangled
 * line whose title happened to hold one sailed through and produced the very
 * garbage agent this exists to reject — reproduced: a line reading
 * `angel-discord_0.0_…_ Working<tab>on<tab>the thing` parsed as an agent named
 * `angel-discord_0.0_…_ Working`, with `rejected: 0`, so nothing refused and
 * nothing was counted.
 *
 * So the second field is CHECKED FOR SHAPE. `#{window_index}.#{pane_index}`
 * is always two integers separated by a dot, tmux always produces it, and no
 * mangled line can fake it. A truncated `session<tab>0.0` still passes, which
 * keeps the deliberate policy above intact.
 *
 * ⚠️ A mistake in OUR OWN format string is a different problem and is not
 * caught here. It is also not constructible in the form the issue imagined:
 * `PANE_FORMAT` is derived by joining `PANE_COLUMNS` with a tab, so a `\t`
 * cannot be dropped from it by hand. What can happen is a column being added,
 * removed or reordered, and the round-trip test over a hand-built line catches a
 * merge or a reorder — though not an appended column, which nothing currently
 * would. That is a gap in the tests rather than something this guard should
 * try to cover.

 * How much this pane deserves to be the card for its name. Lower wins.
 *
 * ⚠️ FIVE tiers, because two different pairs of cases used to tie here and a tie

 * i.e. picks arbitrarily. Both ties were introduced by the commit that removed
 * the Discord coupling from `isFleetSession`, and both were wrong-agent bugs of
 * exactly the kind this branch exists to prevent:
 *
 *   1. `tmux new -s mikey` with Claude running in it now satisfied
 *      `isAgentSession` via the new process arm, so the impostor tied with the
 *      real `mikey-discord` at tier 0. tmux lists `mikey` first, so the impostor
 *      WON: the real agent vanished from the board, and the surviving card read
 *      the real agent's commitments, typed `/clear` into the impostor's pane,
 *      and then tombstoned the real agent's record. One conversation destroyed,
 *      the cost of a different one displayed, and a false claim that the real
 *      agent's holdings were gone while they were intact.
 *   2. Inside a genuine `zeta-discord`, a `node` pane (a build watcher in a
 *      split) tied with the real agent's version-string pane, because
 *      `isAgentSession`'s legacy arm accepts `node` for npm-global installs.
 *      Pane `0.0` won, so `/clear` and a bare Enter were typed into a process
 *      that EXECUTES text rather than reading it as a slash command.
 *
 * ⚠️ CRASHED OUTRANKS LEGACY, and that ordering is deliberately the less
 * convenient one. Inside a real `<agent>-discord` session, a bare `node` pane
 * cannot be told apart from the agent itself: an npm-global Claude install
 * fronts as `node`, and so does a build watcher in a split. Ranking `node`
 * higher meant that when the agent CRASHED to a shell, the watcher won the name
 * — so the board reported "we cannot tell" instead of "not running", hiding the
 * crash on the one card whose Restart button exists for it, and if the
 * watcher's tail ever matched an idle marker, `/clear` plus a bare Enter went
 * into a `node` process, which EXECUTES text rather than reading it.
 *
 * Both readings are wrong in one direction or the other, so the tie is settled
 * on which wrongness is recoverable:
 *
 *   - Picking the shell when `node` was really an npm-global agent: the board
 *     says `stopped` for something that is running, and typing is refused.
 *     **Restart still works** (the session name is still ours), which is the
 *     recovery, and the operator can see the pane themselves.
 *   - Picking `node` when it was really a watcher: the board hides a crash and
 *     may type an executable string into an unrelated process. **Nothing
 *     recovers that.**
 *
 * ⚠️ So the known cost, stated rather than discovered: an npm-global agent that
 * shares its session with any shell pane reads as `stopped` and is
 * restart-only. That is a real regression for that setup and it is the price of
 * not typing into a build watcher.
 *
 * ⚠️ The tier is WIDER than "a shell": `RANK_NAMED_CRASHED` is every named-ours
 * pane that is not native Claude and not one of the legacy names, so `vim`,
 * `ssh`, `python3`, `less` and `man` all land in it and outrank a `node` pane.
 *
 * That used to matter twice over, because `classify` held a SECOND and looser
 * definition of "no Claude here" — a six-name shell denylist — so a winning
 * `vim` pane was not reported as stopped, its screen was scraped instead, and
 * `idle`, `working`, `needs_you` and `rate_limited` were all reachable from
 * arbitrary text. **That is fixed**: `classify` and `isAgentSession` both derive
 * from `isClaudeCommand` now, and `status.test.js`'s "a crashed agent is
 * reported stopped, not scraped off whatever replaced it" pins it for six
 * commands.
 *
 * ⚠️ This note described that gap as OPEN for one commit after the same commit
 * closed it — a comment claiming a defect that no longer exists, which is the
 * inverse of the failure this file keeps warning about and just as costly: the
 * next reader either chases a phantom or "fixes" it by re-loosening `classify`,
 * which is the actual bug.
 *
 * ⚠️ The ordering principle, and the reason a crashed agent outranks a stranger:
 * **the session name is the only evidence of WHOSE a pane is.** A Claude process
 * in a session we cannot name is somebody else's Claude. So every named-ours
 * pane, including one that has crashed to a shell, beats an unnamed one — which
 * is also the case restart exists for.
 *
 * This does NOT re-couple anything to Discord. A non-Discord agent still ranks
 * (tier 3), still appears, and is still typeable. The name only settles a TIE
 * against a same-named session that does carry the suffix.

 * therefore own transcripts in several places while another agent's directory
 * looks like a plausible match for a name it does not own. That failure is the
 * dangerous kind: it finds *a* transcript, so it looks like it worked, and
 * reports confident numbers from the wrong session.
 *
 * The registry records each agent's live `session_id`, and a transcript is
 * named for its session id. That is an exact identity, not a resemblance, so
 * we resolve by it and search every project directory for the file.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️ The registry is keyed on the SESSION name, and this function used to
 * reconstruct that name by appending `-discord`.
 *
 * For the existing fleet the two are the same string — the session really is
 * `angel-discord` — so nothing looked wrong. For an agent Kosmos creates, whose
 * session is simply `kosmos-demo`, the reconstruction asks for
 * `kosmos-demo-discord_0.0.json`, which never exists. The entry sitting right
 * beside it is called `kosmos-demo_0.0.json`.
 *
 * The consequence was the last piece of Discord coupling still visible to a
 * user: a created agent showed on the board with its name and its role and then
 * `model unknown` and a dashed, unknowable memory ring, permanently, because no
 * transcript could be found for it. Measured on a real agent created through
 * the product on 2026-08-10.
 *
 * ⚠️ And an entry that says whose it is is CHECKED rather than trusted by its
 * filename. It records its own `session_name`, so we confirm the file belongs to
 * the agent we asked about instead of inferring it from what it is called. An
 * entry with no `session_name` at all cannot be checked and is still taken on
 * its filename, which is the pre-existing behaviour and is said here so the
 * guarantee is not read as broader than it is — a file
 * named for one agent holding another's session id would otherwise produce
 * confident numbers about the wrong conversation, which is the exact failure
 * this whole resolution path was written to avoid.

 * succeeds). So a local session called `../../something-discord` is tied by the
 * legacy suffix arm and would have this function read a JSON file outside the
 * root and take a session id from it.
 *
 * `instructions.registryKey` exists to refuse exactly that, and threading the

 * `readIdentity` pointed at the operator's live `~/work/workers`. A test suite
 * that believed it was sandboxed was still reading real agents' files, and the
 * sandbox comment in server.test.js said so in good faith while being wrong.
 *
 * ⚠️ The ROOT is now shared. The per-agent SEGMENT still is not: `readIdentity`
 * below joins the verbatim `sessionName`, while `instructions.fileFor` joins
 * `safeKey(sessionName)`. For any agent whose session name is not already its
 * own sanitised form, those two resolve to different directories, so the board
 * can show a derived name and role read from one file while staleness reports
 * on another.
 *
 * ⚠️ An earlier version of this said "it fails safe in both directions". That
 * is false, and the correction matters because the unsafe direction is a
 * CROSS-AGENT WRITE. Measured with two agents whose names collide under
 * `safeKey` (`mybot` and `my.bot`), each with its own worker directory:
 * `readIdentity('my.bot')` read `my.bot`'s file, while `fileFor('my.bot')`
 * resolved to `mybot`'s, `read` returned `mybot`'s text and `staleness`
 * returned a confident `current` computed from it. `knownAgent` compares
 * `sessionName === safeKey(name)`, so `PUT /api/agent/my.bot/instructions`
 * passes the gate and rewrites `mybot`'s boot file.
 *
 * There are no such collisions on this machine, checked rather than assumed,
 * and `server.js` states the same risk accurately at `knownAgent`. The real fix
 * is one identity per agent instead of a name sanitised in one place and taken
 * verbatim in another, which reaches the avatar and profile stores too.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE DISPLAY NAME IS NOW ON THAT LIST. `readIdentity` reads
 * `store.readProfile(sessionName)` for the name a person typed at creation, and
 * `readProfile` resolves through `safeKey` — while the file read three lines
 * below it joins the session name VERBATIM. So the same split runs through this
 * one function: for a colliding pair, the recorded display name comes from one
 * agent's profile and the instruction file from the other's, and the card would
 * show `mybot`'s name over `my.bot`'s role. It is the mildest consumer of the
 * collision (a wrong label, not a cross-agent write) and it is named here
 * because the list of things this defect reaches is the whole argument for
 * fixing it properly, and a list that quietly stops being complete stops making

 * audit (#188, and the architecture note on #253: reports as truth, readers
 * as evidence -- both, never a choice between them).
 *
 * The precedence, in order, and each line is a rule rather than a tiebreak:
 *
 *   1. No report -> the scraped verdict, untouched. An agent that never
 *      adopted the verb renders exactly as today.
 *   2. STRUCTURE OUTRANKS ANY CLAIM ABOUT LIVENESS, both directions. A pane
 *      whose process is gone (`stopped` at STRUCTURED confidence) is stopped
 *      whatever the record's last line says -- an agent cannot report its own
 *      death, so a crash's last word is `working` forever and must not win.
 *      And a live process that reported `stopped` is running, whatever it
 *      said: the scraped state stands, with the contradiction SURFACED.
 *   3. THE RED IS NEVER SUPPRESSED BY A REPORT. A scraped `needs_you` beside
 *      a report that says otherwise renders `needs_you`, with the conflict
 *      surfaced. This is deliberate asymmetry for the interface's one known
 *      hole (a question asked through the runtime's question tool fires no
 *      hook, so the reporter can honestly not know) -- and false calm is the
 *      failure that ships, four times now on this fleet.
 *   4. A fresh reported `working` is working, in the agent's own words.
 *   5. A STALE `working` DECAYS TO UNKNOWN, NEVER TO IDLE. A report that
 *      stopped arriving says the REPORTER stopped, not that the agent
 *      finished; an agent mid-task rendered "resting quietly" is the
 *      false-negative this board has paid for repeatedly, because nobody
 *      investigates calm. Before decaying, the pane gets its say: a screen
 *      still visibly mid-task means the agent is alive and the REPORTER is
 *      broken -- a different fault with a different fix, so that renders as
 *      the scraped working with the contradiction surfaced rather than
 *      collapsing to unknown before the comparison can happen.
 *   6. `idle`, `needs_you` and `blocked` do NOT decay: an idle agent has no
 *      execution to heartbeat with, and a question keeps standing until it
 *      is answered. Their liveness guard is rule 2, not a clock.
 *
 * `conflict` on the answer is a sentence when the two witnesses materially
 * disagree, null otherwise. Surfaced, never silently resolved: a silent
 * override is how two sources of truth become one confident lie.
