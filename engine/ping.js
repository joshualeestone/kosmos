/**
 * Telling the Kosmos team that an agent was created (#238).
 *
 * Josh, 2026-08-22: he wants two numbers on the homepage, installs and agents
 * created, and ruled the collection settled ("we've had a lot of discussion
 * around this and it's fine"). A default-checked box on the create page, which
 * anybody can untick.
 *
 * 🛑 WHAT GOES, EXHAUSTIVELY, AND THIS LIST IS THE FEATURE. Nothing about the
 * agent itself: not its name, its role, its instructions, its model, its
 * projects, or anything typed. The EVENT, never its contents.
 *
 *   installId   a random id made on this machine, in this file, once
 *   at          when
 *   version     which Kosmos
 *   os          the macOS version
 *
 * ⚠️ THE IP ARRIVES ON ITS OWN. Every HTTP request carries one; there is no
 * version of this that does not have it, and it is deliberately NOT NAMED on
 * screen (Josh, 22:55: "we're not saying anything about IP to white collar
 * workers"). Recorded here so a future reader does not take the silence for an
 * oversight and change it in either direction without asking him.
 *
 * 🔑 THE INSTALL ID IS WHAT MAKES THE IP UNNECESSARY FOR THE NUMBERS. A shared
 * office undercounts on IP and a roaming laptop overcounts, and you cannot tell
 * which; a per-install id gives both numbers exactly. (Mona Lisa's point, and
 * the reason this file generates one rather than leaning on the address.)
 *
 * 🛑 IT CAN NEVER BLOCK, SLOW OR FAIL A CREATION. The person asked for an
 * agent, not for a report. Every path here is fire-and-forget with a short
 * timeout, every error is swallowed, and the caller is not given a promise it
 * could accidentally await.

 * somebody may have turned it off and we cannot see which, and the only action
 * gated here is sending something off the machine. Same split as
 * engine/autoupdate.js, for the same reason and in the opposite direction from
 * engmode.js, which gates only whether a panel is visible.

       web/index.html set the condition for that: "removing every control while
       the send stays on is not a tidy-up, it is a removed opt-out. If this box

 * in production inverts it: forget to set it once and nothing is ever sent,
