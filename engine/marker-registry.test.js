/**
 * Every managed-block marker the engine defines is in the registry.
 *
 * 🛑 THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR IS SILENT AND HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES. Each
 * new managed block had to remember to join two separate hand-written lists,
 * one in projects.js and one in you.js, and the comments beside them record the
 * count going up: "same lesson, third sibling", "same lesson, fourth writer".
 * A block that forgets does not fail. It becomes the injection path into itself
 * and every sibling: a marker smuggled through a typed project name or a typed
 * about-you answer fabricates a tight pair, which ends a block early,
 * ambiguates a sibling into silently disabling its own heal, or hands a writer
 * a span to replace inside somebody else's words.
 *
 * 🔑 IT READS THE SOURCE, WHICH IS THE ONLY PLACE THE ANSWER IS COMPLETE.
 * Asking the registry what it contains is asking a list to confirm itself. The
 * question is whether anything in the engine defines a marker the registry has
 * never heard of, and only the files can answer that.
