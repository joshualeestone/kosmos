/* kosmos#1004 (Josh: call it "this computer", not "this Mac"). A COUNT, not a
   spot-check, and the count is the whole point: the first pass at this changed
   FOUR sentences and was reported done, while TWELVE live strings still said
   "this Mac". Nobody was careless -- the four that were fixed were the four
   somebody had looked at, and a spot-check cannot tell you about the ones you
   did not think to open. So this asserts the absence across the file.
   ⚠️ COMMENTS ARE EXEMPT ON PURPOSE. Three of them quote what an older
   sentence used to print, and rewording those falsifies a record rather than
   fixing copy -- the same distinction as editing a bug report to match the
   fix. The classifier below is deliberately crude and errs toward INCLUDING a
   line: a false positive costs someone thirty seconds, a false negative is
   exactly the failure this test exists to stop. */
