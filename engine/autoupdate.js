/**
 * Whether Kosmos installs a new version by itself.
 *
 * 🔑 THIS SWITCH REPLACED ONE THAT DID NOTHING. The row used to read "Tell me
 * when there is a new version", with a hint underneath admitting "Kosmos always
 * tells you. Turning that off is not built yet" -- a control that could not
 * move, next to a sentence explaining that it could not move. Josh, 2026-08-22:
 * "the switch should be on the updates to be automatically update Kosmos ..
 * right now the switch makes no sense". A switch is a promise that something
 * changes when you flip it, and that one was decoration.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWO FAILURE DIRECTIONS ARE DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT, which is why this
 * does not simply copy engmode.js's read():
 *
 *   file absent  -> ON.  Nobody has chosen; this is the shipped default, and a
 *                        beta everybody is meant to be current on should stay
 *                        current without being asked every time.
 *   file corrupt -> OFF. Somebody DID choose and we cannot read which way. The
 *                        only irreversible-feeling action here is installing
 *                        software, so an unreadable choice must not be read as
 *                        consent to install. (engmode fails toward its default
 *                        in both cases because both of its directions are
 *                        merely showing or hiding a panel.)
 *
 * `ok:false` travels with the OFF so the screen can say we could not read it,
 * rather than silently presenting a switch in a position nobody set.
