   * ⚠️ THE UNIQUENESS TEST ABOVE COLLECTS THREE WRITES IN ONE PROCESS, which
   * `process.pid` plus a counter would satisfy on their own. This one asks a
   * SECOND process, which is the case that matters at all.
   *
   * 🛑 AND IT STILL DOES NOT REACH THE REASON THE START TIME IS IN THE NAME,
   * which is worth writing down rather than implying: that reason is PID REUSE.
   * A run that dies between create and rename leaves `…-<pid>-1.new` behind,
   * and a later run that draws the same pid would refuse at seq 1 forever. Two
   * live processes always have different pids, so removing the start time
   * leaves this test green — I checked, rather than assuming the mutation
   * would fire.
   *
   * ⚠️ Reproducing pid reuse from a test would mean waiting for the OS to
   * recycle a pid. So the start time is kept on the argument in trust.js and
   * this test claims only what it can see. A test named for a property it
   * cannot observe is the thing this file keeps finding in itself.
