/**
 * Reading a Codex session, the way `status.js` reads a Claude Code one.
 *
 * #244, phase 1 of running agents on OpenAI. Kosmos does not call an API: it
 * launches a terminal agent, keeps it alive, addresses its pane, and READS THE
 * LOG THAT AGENT WRITES. So a second provider is mostly a second reader.
 *
 * 📌 CODEX WRITES A JSONL ROLLOUT, one object per line, at
 * `~/.codex/sessions/<yyyy>/<mm>/<dd>/rollout-<time>-<uuid>.jsonl` -- the same
 * SHAPE Claude writes, in a different place. (It also keeps a SQLite index over
 * that file; this reads the file, because the file is the record and the index
 * is derived from it.) Measured from a real session on 2026-08-22, not taken
 * from documentation, which does not describe this at all.
 *
 * ⭐ AND IT CARRIES ONE THING CLAUDE'S DOES NOT: the context window, stated by
 * the tool on `task_started`. Kosmos has to ASSUME that number for Claude --
 * the card literally says "against a limit we have assumed rather than
 * watched". Here it is measured, so an OpenAI agent's memory ring rests on a
 * firmer footing than a Claude one.
 *
 * 🛑 WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT CLAIM. The USED half of the ring is not here,
 * because I have not seen a successful run report usage and I will not invent a
 * field name from a failed one. `contextUsed` is null until somebody reads a
 * real completed session and says what carries it. Null renders as "we could
 * not tell", which is this product's honest answer and not a placeholder.
