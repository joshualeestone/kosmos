/**
 * The Claude accounts this machine can run agents on.
 *
 * 🔑 AN ACCOUNT IS A CONFIG DIRECTORY, NOT A LOGIN, and that is the whole of
 * this module's shape. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` selects which directory a Claude Code
 * process uses, and everything that process knows lives in there.
 *
 * 🛑 WHICH MEANS MOVING AN AGENT BETWEEN ACCOUNTS MOVES ITS MEMORY. Transcripts
 * live under `<dir>/projects`, so an agent pointed at a different account reads
 * as having no history — and the fleet's own write-up of this says the failure
 * out loud: *"An agent restarted onto a fresh account comes up with no memory,
 * and nothing on screen says so. It looks like a working agent and behaves like
 * a blank one."* Anything built on top of this module has to say that where the
 * choice is made.
 *
 * 📌 INSTRUCTIONS ARE SAFE, and it is worth stating so nobody re-derives the
 * scare: a Kosmos agent reads its instructions from its own worker folder, which
 * the supervisor passes as the working directory. Those do not live in the
 * config directory and do not move.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NAMING IS LOad-BEARING RATHER THAN COSMETIC. `status.configRoots()`
 * finds `~/.claude` and any `~/.claude-*` that contains a `projects` directory,
 * and that is how memory readings are found. Naming Kosmos's account directories
 * `~/.claude-<label>` therefore keeps memory working across accounts for free.
 * Put them anywhere else and every agent on a second account reads Unknown.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A `.claude-*` DIRECTORY IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY AN ACCOUNT. Measured on
 * this machine: `.claude-account-b` and `.claude-account-c` each carry a
 * `.claude.json` with an `oauthAccount`; `.claude-workers` carries none and is
 * not a login at all. The presence of that record is what makes a directory an
 * account, not the name.
