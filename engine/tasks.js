/**
 * Tasks: things that need doing, which exist whether or not anyone is on
 * them (the pack's definition, stated on the project column). A task lives
 * INSIDE its project's record: its number is issued by the project and is
 * only unique there ("task 15" spans no projects), so the project is the
 * storage unit and the atomic write is the project store's own.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT A TASK DELIBERATELY DOES NOT HAVE, from the pack, because each
 * absence is a claim the system cannot check:
 *   - no writable STATUS: a new task has not started because nobody started
 *     it, and whether an agent is on it is engine/commitments.js's fact to
 *     observe, not a person's to type (the removed "Handed off" rule);
 *   - no person-chosen NUMBER: the project issues it;
 *   - no cross-project list anywhere down the line.
 *
 * ⚠️ CLOSING A TASK DOES NOT STOP AN AGENT. Verified in this repo when the
 * pack was drawn and still true: nothing in tasks can reach into a running
 * session. close() edits Kosmos's own record, exactly like
 * commitments.resolve(). The screen carries the sentence; this file
 * carries the mechanism that makes the sentence true.
 *
 * The `who` field records who the task was GIVEN to, with the same honesty
 * shape as project membership's everSeen: whether we could see that agent
 * at assignment time is recorded, so a typo and a temporarily unreadable
 * agent stay distinguishable later.
