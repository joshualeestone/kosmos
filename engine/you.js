/**
 * The person the agents work for, answered once.
 *
 * The pack's About-you step (first run, no skip, Josh's call): "if they
 * don't want to tell what they wanna be called and who they are then they
 * have no purpose in using this". Two required answers and one optional
 * one, stored in ONE local file, and taught to every agent in the file it
 * boots from -- a managed block with its own markers, beside (never inside)
 * the projects block, because the projects block is removed when an agent
 * leaves its last project and who the person is does not stop being true.
 *
 * ⚠️ The instruction write goes through the SAME machinery as the projects
 * block: projects.findBlock/spliceBlock/removeBlock, parameterized by
 * marker. One derivation of the tight-pair matching and the refuse-on-
 * ambiguity rule, because that logic is what keeps the most powerful write
 * in the product from eating somebody's words, and a second copy of it is
 * how a fix lands in one and not the other.
 *
 * ⚠️ This module writes one local file and local instruction files;
 * nothing else. That is a fact about the MODULE, not a privacy promise.
 * Those instruction files are prompt text, so what they contain reaches
 * Claude with every request the agent makes. The first-run copy says so
 * explicitly. Do not restore "nothing here leaves this computer" on the
 * strength of what this module does.

/* ---- the person's picture ------------------------------------------------
 * Josh, 2026-08-22: "we need the user avatar somewhere in settings still",
 * asked right after "can the org chart use actual avatars". It can, and does;
 * the gap is that the PERSON has no picture anywhere, so "You" is plain text in
 * the org hub and in every message row. It shows worst on the chart, where a
 * ring of faces surrounds one text label and the label is the person.
 *
 * 🛑 ITS OWN FILE, NOT A ROW IN THE AGENT AVATAR STORE, and this is the one
 * trap in the feature. `engine/messages.js` already refuses to let a string
 * match promote an agent: *"'you' is a legal tmux session name, and the one
 * thing the screens must never do is promote an agent to operator on a string
 * match."* Storing the person's picture as an agent called `you` would put that
 * exact collision in the STORAGE layer, where it is harder to see -- and no
 * spelling escapes it, because `store.safeKey` strips punctuation, so `y.ou`
 * and `you` are one key. An agent genuinely called "You" must be able to hold
 * its own picture at the same time as the person, and only separate storage
 * makes that true. (Found by Mona Lisa while specifying this.)
 *
 * ⚠️ A PICTURE, AND NOTHING ELSE. The alternative -- a picture plus a name and
 * a role -- would turn "You" into a named participant on four screens and edge
 * toward looking like an account, which the welcome screen promises there is
 * not. The name already exists in `you.json` and is deliberately not shown in
 * those places; this does not change that.
