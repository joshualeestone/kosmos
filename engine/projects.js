/**
 * Projects — the work, and which agents are on it.
 *
 * A project **is a folder on disk** (§4, Josh 2026-08-06). Not a container this
 * platform fills: a pointer at work the person already has, which is why an
 * agent can be aimed at a repo that already exists without us adding a single
 * file to it. Everything this module writes lives in app data, never in the
 * project folder (§7b).
 *
 * ⚠️ **Membership is an ORGANISING fact and never a boundary**, and that is the
 * one thing in this file that must not be softened later. Access levels were
 * dropped 2026-08-11: every agent runs at full permission, nothing is enforced,
 * and *a level that is not enforced is worse than none, because it is believed*
 * by somebody with no way to check. So nothing here returns a permission, and
 * nothing that consumes it may render one — no locks, no "access", no
 * "restricted", no wording implying an agent cannot reach something.
 *
 * ## What is actually true when you put an agent on a project
 *
 * Four claims are available and only three of them are ours to make:
 *
 * | Claim | | |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | this project is that folder | ✅ | we can stat it, and do, on every read |
 * | these agents are on this project | ✅ | it is our own record |
 * | we told this agent where the folder is | ✅ | we wrote the line and can show it |
 * | this agent **knows** it, works there, or is confined to it | ❌ | never |
 *
 * The fourth is false in three separate ways, which is why it gets its own
 * paragraph rather than a footnote. An instruction file is read ONCE, at
 * session start, so a running agent is still working from what it read at boot.
 * An agent may have no instruction file this product can write at all. And
 * nothing constrains where any agent goes regardless. Hence `told` below is a
 * verdict with a reason attached, never a boolean that reads as knowledge.

 * against. Measured: an instruction file carrying a stranded start marker plus
 * a real block lost the user's whole "## House rules" section on removal, and
 * `syncAgent` still answered `told`, so the screen said "Kosmos told it where
 * this folder is" about a write that had just eaten somebody's words. Two
 * derivations of one question is this codebase's worst habit and it grew back
 * inside the fix for the last instance of it.
 *
 * BOTH single-marker cases are reachable from a hand edit or an interrupted
 * write, and each breaks a different naive rule:
 *   a stranded START before a real block — first-start-to-first-end spans them
 *     and eats everything between;
 *   a stranded END before a real block — first-end-then-look-backwards finds no
 *     start, so a block is appended EVERY time and the file grows without bound
 *     until it outgrows the write limit and every save fails, including the
 *     person's own.
 * So: pair the markers, and refuse rather than guess. `findBlock` scans STARTS
 * left to right and takes the first one whose next marker is an END with no
 * second START in between; a stranded marker on either side is skipped rather
 * than paired across. Two well-formed blocks are AMBIGUOUS and refused outright
 * — that refusal is the load-bearing half, and an earlier version of this
