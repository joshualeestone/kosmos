 *
 * The point of this file is not to hold a list. It is to make the restart
 * confirmation incapable of lying, and there is exactly one way a simpler
 * version still lies:
 *
 *   **An empty list is not evidence of nothing pending.** A missing file, an
 *   agent that has never reported, and an agent genuinely holding nothing all
 *   produce the same empty array. Render that as "nothing to lose" and you have
 *   rebuilt the bug this whole codebase is built against -- a check that cannot
 *   tell "fine" from "I can't see it", showing green.
 *
 * So an empty list only counts when it is an *assertion*, not an absence. The
 * agent has to say "I am holding nothing", and it has to have said it recently.
 * Everything below follows from that.
