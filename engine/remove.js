/**
 * Removing an agent from Kosmos, and putting it back.
 *
 * ⚠️ REMOVE IS NOT DELETE, and the whole shape of this module follows from
 * that. Removing means: stop it, do not let it come back, and take it off the
 * board. **Nothing on disk is deleted, ever.** The agent's folder, the
 * instructions somebody wrote for it, its log — all untouched. Delete is a
 * different feature and does not exist yet.
 *
 * That makes removal REVERSIBLE, which changes what the screen has to say: no
 * "this cannot be undone", no list of consequences to weigh. The person is
 * deciding whether to see this agent in Kosmos, not whether to destroy it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT WORKS ON EVERY AGENT, including ones another tool created. An
 * earlier version refused those because we had not made them. That is wrong for
 * this product: Kosmos manages a fleet, and a fleet agent it cannot manage is a
 * hole rather than a safeguard. What it does not do is destroy anything of
 * theirs — it stops them, and it can start them again.
 *
 * ⚠️ "EVERY AGENT" IS NOT "EVERY CARD", and the earlier wording of this
 * sentence said the second. The board draws a card for any pane running Claude,
 * including a `tmux new -s notes` somebody opened by hand — and `plan` refuses
 * those, because the board will not vouch that the session belongs to the agent
 * whose name it is filed under. That refusal is right, so the promise narrows
 * to match it rather than the other way round.
 *
 * ⚠️ Which puts the weight on RESTORE actually reversing. Removing an agent
 * another tool created disables a launchd job we did not write, so "reversible
 * by design" is only true if the implementation reverses: the exact label is
 * recorded at removal, and restoring re-enables that label and bootstraps that
 * plist. A remove that cannot cleanly restore is a broken agent, not a
 * reversible one.
 *
 * The mechanism is launchd's own, which is why nothing has to be moved or
 * deleted to make a removal stick:
 *
 *   `bootout`  stops it now, for this login session.
 *   `disable`  keeps it from starting at the next one. Persisted by launchd,
 *              reversed by `enable`, and it touches no files at all.
 *
 * Measured on this machine: `disable` works on a label that is not currently
 * loaded, `print-disabled` reflects it, and `enable` flips it back.

 * way back that this whole module is shaped around avoiding. The fail-open then
 * hides the damage: the board simply shows them again, running or not.
 *
 * So writers use `readRemovedForWrite`, which distinguishes "there is no file

     to the default home. So a CREATED OpenAI agent, the common case, wrote a
     trust entry that my step would have skipped.

     was the wrong lesson applied to the wrong direction. #1313 was a CHECK
     reading a different home than the WRITE used. Here the requirement is the
     opposite: the removal must fall back EXACTLY where the write fell back.

 *
 * 🛑 IT KILLS THE SESSION AND LETS LAUNCHD DO THE REST, and that is the whole
 * mechanism. `plistFor` sets `KeepAlive` true with a thirty-second
 * `ThrottleInterval`, and the supervisor ADOPTS an existing session rather than
 * replacing it. So bouncing the launchd job alone would restart the supervisor,
 * which would find the old session, adopt it, and change nothing — a Restart
 * button that reports success and restarts nothing. The session has to go first.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT WAIT AROUND TO SAY IT WORKED. The new session appears when
 * launchd re-runs the supervisor, up to `ThrottleInterval` later. Blocking on
 * that would hold a request open for half a minute; claiming it had already
 * happened would be a lie of the exact kind this file refuses. The verdict says
 * the session was ended and that it comes back on its own, which is what is
 * true at the moment we answer.
