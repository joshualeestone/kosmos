 * The kosmos command as THIS machine can actually run it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Bare `kosmos` was a lie on every stock install: the installer links
 * the CLI into ~/.local/bin, which is not on a default macOS PATH, so the
 * taught command failed with "command not found" in every agent's shell --
 * silently, because the engine is never reached and no refusal row can
 * exist (2026-08-18, Josh's machine; the person hit the identical wall in
 * their own terminal minutes earlier).
 *
 * Layouts, probed rather than assumed, most specific first:
 *   installed   this file lives at $KOSMOS_HOME/app/engine; the CLI is
 *               $KOSMOS_HOME/bin/kosmos (stable across updates -- an
 *               update swaps app/, not bin/).
 *   source      this file lives at <repo>/engine; the CLI is
 *               <repo>/install/kosmos.
 * Neither provable: fall back to bare `kosmos` rather than inventing a
 * path we did not verify. `probeRoot` exists for tests.

 * installed layout is positively present ($KOSMOS_HOME/bin/kosmos AND
 * $KOSMOS_HOME/app/server.js both exist -- the same conjunction kosmosCli's
 * installed arm uses). #2454: engine/boardrestart gates its `kosmos restart`
 * self-restart on this, so a from-source `node server.js` board (which a stop
 * would never bring back) is NEVER restarted -- it resolves to null here and
 * falls through to the manual-restart banner.
 *
 * 📌 #570: ON WINDOWS THIS IS ALWAYS null, AND THAT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER RATHER
 * THAN A MISSING BRANCH. The shipped Windows bundle
 * (`tools/build-kosmos-windows.sh`) is `Kosmos.exe` + `runtime\node.exe` +
 * `app\` -- there is NO `bin\kosmos` wrapper of any spelling, so a win32 arm here
 * could only invent a path that does not exist. What it must not do is leave a
 * caller believing a restart is available: `engine/boardrestart.js` no longer
 * reaches this arm on win32 at all (it asks engine/win32board.js whether the
 * board's logon task started this board), so the null is a true negative that
 * routes to a mechanism, not a dead end. The separate defect that agents are
 * TAUGHT a bare `kosmos msg` on Windows lives in `kosmosCliShown` above and is
 * BLOCKER 1's, not this one's -- see .claude/plans/WINDOWS-ROADMAP.md §3c.
