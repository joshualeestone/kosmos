/**
 * What the restart confirmation says a restart would cost.
 *
 * 🛑 THIS DIALOG IS THE REASON `engine/commitments.js` EXISTS. Its opening
 * line: restarting an agent kills whatever it had in flight, and the fresh
 * session reports a confident all-clear. Its purpose line: "The point of this
 * file is not to hold a list. It is to make the restart confirmation incapable
 * of lying."
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE DIALOG HAD NEVER BEEN DRAWN. `server.js` attaches a commitment
 * block to every agent, its comment says "it is that value the restart
 * confirmation needs" and "the restart dialog reads these", and the page did
 * not contain the word `commitments` anywhere. Engine and route complete,
 * screen absent.
 *
 * 🔑 THE ONE RULE UNDER ALL OF IT: "nothing to lose" is honest ONLY when the
 * agent said so RECENTLY. `clear` is earned. `unknown` covers never-reported,
 * stale past thirty minutes, future-dated and untied, and rendering any of
 * those as "nothing pending" is the confident all-clear the file exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Found by Mona Lisa, who withdrew her own no-dialog ruling on #259 after
 * reading commitments.js.
