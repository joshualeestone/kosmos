# Kosmos

Manage a workforce of AI agents on your own Mac. Your agents, your
computer, your AI subscription.

## Installing (the product's front door)

End users install with one line, which the marketing page distributes:

    curl -fsSL https://installkosmos.com/setup | sh

That runs `install/setup.sh`: it checksum-verifies and installs a private
tmux bundle and the Kosmos bundle (the app + a pinned Node runtime + the
`kosmos` command) under `~/.local/share/kosmos`, creates a locally-built
Kosmos.app carrying the gold-K icon (assets/Kosmos.icns, generated from
Josh's 1024px master in assets/Kosmos-1024.png), links
`~/.local/bin/kosmos`, and starts the board.
The icon goes to `/Applications` when the user can write there without a
password (it proves ownership before ever replacing a bundle there),
falling back to `~/Applications`. It never replaces an occupant of
either folder that it cannot prove is its own; in three shapes
(something foreign in the system spot with the home folder aliased to
it, a foreign spot whose surroundings cannot even be checked, or a
foreign Kosmos.app in `~/Applications` when that is where the icon was
headed) that means no icon is written at all, and the transcript says so. A fresh install that
confirms its own board is running ends by opening the dashboard in the
browser (updates stay quiet; `KOSMOS_NO_OPEN=1` suppresses it).
`kosmos start|stop|restart|status|open|version` manages it after that.
`sh -s -- --uninstall` reverses everything except the agents' own folders,
the AgentWorkforce store (profiles, avatars, commitments, and the messages
you have sent agents from a project) and `~/Kosmos/Projects` (the folders
Kosmos makes when you name a project rather than pointing at one): user
work and records about it stay; the app and its plumbing go.
Apple silicon, macOS 13.5+ (gated in a sentence, and the builders refuse
to pack a release artifact above that floor).

Release artifacts are produced in two steps on a build machine with the
Xcode command line tools: `tools/build-tmux-from-source.sh <out>` first
(downloads ~15MB of pinned, checksum-verified sources and compiles tmux
plus its three libraries against the floor in tools/macos-floor, several
minutes; a Homebrew-copied tmux inherits the build machine's macOS as its
minimum and the gate refuses it; version bumps go through
KOSMOS_TRUST_FIRST_FETCH=1, see the script header), then
`TMUX_SOURCE=<out>/tmux-floor-prefix/bin/tmux tools/build-tmux-bundle.sh`
and `tools/build-kosmos-bundle.sh` (each emits its tarball plus the
`.sha256` the installer requires, the tmux one carrying the harvested
upstream licences and dependency versions), published under
installkosmos.com/dist. Named debt before first publish: a minos stamp is a
promise, not a run; one real macOS 13.x boot should run the tarball.

## Status: Phase 1

It shows you what the agents on this machine are doing, and it can now change
some of what they are: their picture, what you call their job, and the
instruction file each one reads when it starts.

**It can also make one.** Pick what the agent is for, give it a name, and it
writes the folder and the instructions, installs a launchd job, loads it, and
then WATCHES THE BOARD until it can see the agent running before it says so.

Every agent's job runs the same supervisor, `bin/agent-supervisor.sh`, with its
own name as an argument. One file rather than a copy per agent, so a change to
it reaches agents that already exist: it is reinstalled whenever an agent is
created, and each running agent picks it up at its next start.

No terminal, and nothing claimed that was not observed: if the board cannot see
the agent after thirty seconds, the screen says that instead.

⚠️ Two conditions on "reaches agents that already exist", worth stating rather
than implying. On a machine where no further agent is ever created, nothing
reinstalls it. And an agent made by a version before this one has its own copy
of the old script and keeps it: nothing migrates those.

**It can also remove one**, from the bottom of that agent's own detail screen,
behind a confirmation that names the agent.

⚠️ **Remove is not delete, and only Remove exists.** Removing an agent takes it
off this board and stops it starting again. It does not delete anything: not the
agent's folder, not the instructions you wrote, not its startup file. That is
what "The agent's folder and the contents you wrote for it will not be deleted"
on the confirmation means, and it is meant literally.

**Removed agents can be put back.** They are listed under "Show removed agents"
at the bottom of the Agents tab, each with a Restore button that re-enables the
same startup job that was disabled.

It removes agents it did not create, too. Being able to manage the ones you
already have is the point — so a startup file another tool wrote is disabled
rather than deleted, and Restore turns exactly that one back on.

⚠️ **With one limit, and it is deliberate.** The board also draws a card for any
tmux session that merely happens to be running Claude — a `tmux new -s notes`
you opened yourself. Kosmos will not remove one of those: it cannot tell that
the session belongs to the agent whose name it is filed under, and stopping it
could stop the wrong thing. The screen says so where the Remove control would
otherwise be. Every agent Kosmos made, and every one another tool set up
properly, is removable; a card the board cannot vouch for is not.

**It can also connect Claude.** On first-run step 3, if no subscription is
connected, one click downloads Claude Code (checksum-verified before anything
is executed, with a real progress bar from real bytes), installs it with no
sudo and no Homebrew, and drives the sign-in: the browser opens, the person
signs in, and if Claude hands them a code there is a box here to paste it into.
The finish line is the settings file actually saying `connected` — never a
sentence scraped off a terminal. A screen the driver does not recognise is
reported as "we could not finish", with what the terminal actually said shown,
and the manual path (open Terminal, type `claude`) always offered.

⚠️ **What that flow has NOT proven yet:** the final hop — pasting a real code
and watching credentials land — has only run against a scripted fake, because
completing it for real means signing an agent's machine into a live account.
`docs/browser-checks/live-connect.js` proves everything up to the paste prompt
against the real CLI; the last step belongs to the first walkthrough on a
machine that is not this one.

While a sign-in is in flight there is a real tmux session called
`kosmos-connect` running Claude, so the Agents tab may briefly show it as a
card the board cannot vouch for. That is the board honestly reporting what is
running; the card leaves when the sign-in finishes. A sign-in nobody finishes
does not leave on its own: walking away mid-flow ("Continue anyway") keeps the
window open, and the way to end it is back on setup step 3 (Cancel), or
`tmux kill-session -t "=kosmos-connect"` from Terminal. The name is reserved
(you cannot create an agent called `kosmos-connect`), and every command the
flow sends is pinned to the exact session name. The reservation also means the flow
treats any session with that exact name as its own: a `tmux new -s
kosmos-connect` you opened by hand will be closed when a connect starts.

It **can** message an agent, from a project. Opening a project gives you one
conversation with one agent on it — chosen by a picker that starts on the
project's manager — and sending types the line into that agent's own tmux
session. What the screen says about it is deliberately narrow: "placed into
casey's session just now", or the reason it could not, and never that the agent
read anything. A keystroke reaching a terminal is not evidence that a program
understood it, so there are three verdicts rather than two — `placed`,
`could_not` (nothing of yours reached the pane, so sending again is safe), and
`unconfirmed` (it may already be in that agent's composer, so look at its
screen before sending again). The agent's side of that screen is the live tail
of its terminal, labelled as the terminal and never parsed into speech.

**And it can put every agent on a project in one room.** A project is a room and
its members are in it. The room is the centre column of the project page, with
its own history and a search box. You post into it from there; an agent posts by
running `kosmos msg`, and the sender is derived from the tmux pane that command
ran in rather than claimed, so an agent cannot mistype itself into being a
colleague.

⚠️ **Being in the room is not the same as being spoken to, and the difference is
marked rather than silent.** An @-mention naming a member arrives at that member
as a request; every other member receives the same words, delivered, and marked
`not addressed to you`. Nobody is kept from hearing the room, and nobody is left
to guess whether they were the one asked. An agent that is not on the project
cannot post into that room at all: an unaddressed message to a room full of
agents is how one confused agent steers colleagues who never asked.

⚠️ **A conversation that will not land is stopped, and the stop is visible.** A
pair of agents gets a budget of exchanges an hour, and a room gets its own
larger one, because a room can loop without any two members looping. Crossing a
budget is logged even when the limit is switched off, so a screen can say the
conversation was stopped rather than simply going quiet. Your own posts count
toward nothing.

**What a message can contain.** A file path an agent cites becomes a chip with a
"Show me" button that opens it — but only when that name matches a file the
project's folder actually holds. A path we cannot resolve stays plain text,
because a button that opens nothing is worse than no button, and it is also why
the button can be trusted: it is never offered for something the opener would
refuse. A web address becomes a real link, in a new tab, telling the destination
nothing about where it came from. A fenced block stays in a box of its own so
columns line up and indentation survives.

⚠️ **Nothing inside a quoted block is clickable**, and that is the distinction
rather than an omission. A path an agent CITES is a claim it is making; the same
characters inside a block are content it is SHOWING you, and offering to open
them would open a file the message was only quoting.

📌 **No caption names a block's source**, though the design draws one. Nothing
here can produce it: an agent has no way to say which file and which line a
block came from. A caption would be the first thing on that screen asserting
something nobody computed, so the box ships without one.

**A project keeps a list of its documents.** The files in its folder, newest
first, click one and it opens the way double-clicking would, with a link under
the list to show them all in Finder. ⚠️ That link says Finder because that is
what it does; a screen listing every file for a project is a later slice, and
labelling the button for the thing not built yet is how a product starts lying
about itself.

**An agent can be renamed**, from its own page: the name is a field beside what
it does, saved by the same button. It changes what you call them here, not where
they live on this computer, and not the name other agents use to reach them.

⚠️ **If you need to remove one by hand** — because it was made before this
existed, or because a removal reported that it could not finish — a created
agent has a launchd job that starts it at every login, and deleting its folder is
not enough:

    launchctl enable gui/$UID/com.kosmos.agent.<name>
    launchctl bootout gui/$UID/com.kosmos.agent.<name>
    rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kosmos.agent.<name>.plist
    tmux kill-session -t "=<name>"
    rm -rf ~/work/workers/<name>
    # and what this app remembered about it, which is kept elsewhere:
    rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/AgentWorkforce/avatars/<name>.*
    rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/AgentWorkforce/profiles/<name>.json
    rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/AgentWorkforce/commitments/<name>.json

⚠️ **The `enable` line first, and it is the one people will not think of.** A
removal that got as far as disabling the job and then could not finish leaves a
**disabled override in launchd's per-user database, keyed on the label** — and
nothing on disk records it, so deleting the plist and the folder does not clear
it. Create an agent under that name later and launchd refuses to start it, with
nothing in the product to explain why. `enable` is what removes the override;
it is harmless on a label that was never disabled, which is why it is listed
unconditionally rather than as a special case.

The `=` is not a typo. Without it tmux resolves a target by PREFIX, so
`kill-session -t sam` will happily kill `samantha-discord` if no session is
called exactly `sam`. If you started the board with `AGENT_WORKFORCE_WORKERS` or
`AGENT_WORKFORCE_LAUNCH` set, substitute those paths for the two above.

The startup script refuses to touch a session it cannot prove is its own, so a
leftover job cannot take a name somebody else is using — but it will sit there
waiting, which is its own kind of surprise.

⚠️ That instruction file is the real thing an agent boots from, not a copy, so
editing it here changes how that agent behaves the next time it starts. The
version it replaces is kept beside it as `CLAUDE.md.previous`.

⚠️ It answers only on **loopback**, and checks the `Host` header as well as
the address, so a page on another site cannot reach it by pointing its own DNS
at your machine. The `Host` check refuses a reverse proxy too, which is
deliberate: there is no authentication here.

⚠️ **It also refuses a write that came from another page**, which is a
different hole and the more dangerous one, because it needs nothing to be
misconfigured. A POST with a form content type needs no CORS preflight, so
before that guard existed any site you visited could create an agent on your
machine. Measured against this server, not theorised.

If you genuinely want to reach this from somewhere else, name that host in
`AGENT_WORKFORCE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and understand that anyone who reaches that URL
can rewrite the file any of your agents boots from, make new ones, type
into a running agent's session (answering its prompts on its behalf), and
make this machine download and execute Claude and drive a sign-in
(`POST /api/connect/start`).

    node server.js      # then open http://127.0.0.1:4317

If Claude or tmux is not where this expects (an Intel Mac keeps Homebrew at
`/usr/local`; an npm-global Claude is not in `~/.local/bin`), creation refuses
and says so. Name them instead of editing the code:

    AGENT_WORKFORCE_CLAUDE_BIN=/usr/local/bin/claude \
    AGENT_WORKFORCE_TMUX_BIN=/usr/local/bin/tmux node server.js

## Projects

A project is **a folder**, plus the agents you have put on it. Name it and
Kosmos makes `~/Kosmos/Projects/<name>` itself — that is the default, and it
exists so that adding your first project does not send you into the macOS file
picker, where the first folder anyone opens raises the system's "Kosmos wants to
access files in your Documents folder" prompt. **Pointing at a folder you
already have** is one link away on the same screen, and is still the way to
reach work that lives somewhere else, including a repo you already have.

Nothing this app generates is ever written into a project folder; everything it
keeps lives in its own store.

Three caveats belong here rather than in a comment, because each is something a
person could otherwise believe and have no way to check.

⚠️ **Putting an agent on a project is not a permission.** It is how you say
which agents belong to which work, and nothing more. Every agent on this machine
runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and nothing is enforced anywhere, so
you will find no lock icon, no "access", and no wording suggesting an agent
cannot reach something. A boundary that is not enforced is worse than none,
because the person believing it has no way to find out.

⚠️ **Making an agent writes one line into Claude Code's config.** Kosmos creates
the agent's folder and writes its instructions into it, and Claude Code then
asks whether that folder can be trusted. Since the folder is one this app made a
second earlier, Kosmos answers that question for it, by adding
`hasTrustDialogAccepted` for that one exact path to `~/.claude.json`. It is
another program's file, so the write is deliberately narrow: only folders this
app created, never one you chose yourself, never a global setting, and it is
undone if the startup job could not be installed. (Not the same as the agent
failing later: Kosmos can only say the job was accepted, so an agent whose job
installs and then dies keeps its line.) If the write does not take, nothing breaks:
the agent starts and asks you once, which is what happened before this existed.
If Claude Code had already recorded that folder, whatever it recorded is put
back when the line is undone, rather than simply removed.

Removing an agent does **not** take that line back out, and that is deliberate
rather than an oversight. At that moment nothing can tell an entry this app
wrote from one you made yourself, and deleting your own answer about a folder is
worse than leaving a line about a folder that is gone. Claude Code keeps such
lines for every folder you have ever opened anyway.

⚠️ **A running agent does not see the change.** Putting an agent on a project
writes the project's folder into that agent's instruction file, and an agent
reads that file once, when it starts. So the screen says *"it will see that the
next time it starts"* rather than anything in the present tense. Where the file
could not be written at all — an agent with no folder on this machine, or one
whose instructions live somewhere this app will not touch — the membership is
still recorded and the row says we could not tell it, and why.

What removal does, in both directions: removing an agent from a project, or
removing the project itself, takes our record away and **tries** to take the
block back out of the affected agents' instruction files. ⚠️ **That second half
can fail, for every reason the first write can** — the agent has stopped, has no
folder on this machine, or keeps its instructions somewhere this app will not
touch. When it does, the record is still gone and the screen says which agents
still mention the project and why, because a block left in a file naming a
project that no longer exists is something only you can clear. **Nothing in the
folder is ever deleted**, and a project can be added again — though the name you
gave it and the agents you put on it are not kept.

## The rule this codebase is built around

An agent we cannot read is shown as **unknown**, never as something healthy.
Most monitoring bugs are the same shape: the check cannot tell "fine" from
"I can't see it", and shows green. Every value carries how it was determined,
and a value we cannot stand behind is left out rather than guessed.

⚠️ One deliberate narrowing, named here rather than left for you to find: an
agent sitting at its own prompt is reported **idle** rather than unknown, on the
evidence that Claude's own input box is on screen. That makes `unknown`
effectively unreachable for a pane where Claude is running. It was worth it
because an agent left waiting for you otherwise decayed into "we cannot see this
one" as soon as its last output scrolled away, on the very card you had just
created. The residual risk is a Claude whose interface has hung: it still draws
that box. See `classify` in `engine/status.js`.

## A note on live data

The status engine reads a real fleet doing real work. Pane titles and
transcripts can contain client names, financial work and private
correspondence.

- Fixtures are synthetic or redacted. Never a captured slice of live state.
- Anything captured from a real machine stays out of this repo.
- Screenshots are held to the same rule, and the rule is about **where the text
  came from**, not about which words it contains. A shot of the running board
  ships whatever the fleet happened to be doing that minute, and those task
  lines have carried client names and financial work.
- So: a board fed by a **fake tmux with invented task lines** is fine, and the
  names on the cards are not the sensitive part -- a name grants nobody
  anything. `docs/screenshots/remove-*.png` are exactly that. Clarified
  2026-08-11 because the earlier wording ("agent names plus task lines are
  already a disclosure") read as a ban on the names, and a rule stricter than
  its reason gets worked around rather than followed.

This repo is public. Anything you commit is public the moment you push it, and so is the history.

## After you merge: a running board keeps the engine it started with

`web/index.html` is read from disk on every request, so a merged page change is
live the moment it lands. `engine/*.js` and `server.js` are not: node holds what
it `require`d at startup. A board left running across a merge serves a current
page on a stale engine, and nothing on screen says so yet (#338 is the notice).
Measured 2026-08-23: six hours, three merged PRs, `/api/roles` still answering
from the morning's file.

So, after merging anything under `engine/` or `server.js`, restart the board you
are looking at:

    kosmos restart

On a machine whose `com.kosmos.board` plist carries `KeepAlive` (a development
setup, not the shipped one, which deliberately has none: `install/setup.sh`),
`launchctl stop com.kosmos.board` is enough; it comes straight back. A user's
install never needs this: the updater stops and starts the board itself.
