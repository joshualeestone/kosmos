 * So this degrades to "we could not see them", never to "you have no projects",
 * and the route that reports fleet state alongside the list says so explicitly
 * with `agentsUnreadable` rather than pretending the roster is empty.
 *
 * ⚠️ `snapshot()`, NOT `paneRoster()`, and this was a real shipped defect for
 * the whole of this branch's life. `paneRoster` returns exactly
 * `{sessionName, session, isNamedOurs}` — it has never carried `name`, `state`
 * or `because`. `describe` reads all three, so every member row rendered with
 * the machine name instead of the display name (`claudebot`, never
 * `Splinter` — the ONE thing this feature's own docstring promises), with
 * `state: undefined` showing as a bare "Can't tell", and with `needsYou` and
 * `working` permanently zero, so the "1 needs you" the list exists to draw
 * could never appear. It is visible in the committed screenshots.
 *
 * It survived six rounds of review because THE TEST FIXTURE INVENTED THE
 * FIELDS. `ROSTER` in the engine suite carried `name`/`state`/`because`, which
 * nothing in this repo produces, so the tests measured a world that does not
 * exist. Measuring against the wrong world is worse than not measuring: it
 * produces confidence.

 *
 * ⚠️ And a correction to what an earlier version of this comment claimed. It

 * `an.gel`, `ANGEL`, `a n g e l` and `ang!el` all pass and all resolve to
 * `angel/CLAUDE.md`. That is harmless while it is the same agent.
 *
 * The real latent risk, stated accurately: if two agents ever exist whose names
 * sanitise to the SAME key (sessions `mybot` and `my.bot`), the gate cannot
 * tell them apart and both read and write one file. Nothing detects that today.
 * There are currently no such collisions and no agent whose name differs from
 * its own sanitised form, both checked rather than assumed. The real fix is one
 * identity per agent instead of a name that is sanitised in one place and
 * verbatim in another, which is a change to the avatar and profile stores too.

 * request looks like, so the Host check passes. The attacker cannot READ the
 * answer, and does not need to: the side effect is the attack. A real worker
 * directory and a real launchd job were created on this machine by that
 * request while this was being written.
 *
 * It is worse than a drive-by write because of what the job is: `RunAtLoad`,
 * `KeepAlive`, and an agent started with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` that
 * comes back on every reboot, whose instruction file any subsequent write can
 * rewrite.
 *
 * ⚠️ Why the EXISTING writes were not reachable this way, which is the thing
 * the old comment got wrong: they are all `PUT` and `DELETE`, and those are
 * never simple requests, so a browser preflights them, this server answers the
 * `OPTIONS` with a 404 carrying no CORS headers, and the browser drops the real
 * request. `POST /api/agents` was the first route on this server a stranger's
 * page could actually reach. "No worse than what is here" was false, and it was
 * false in the direction that matters.
 *
 * Two checks, because either alone leaves a gap:
 *
 *   1. `Origin`, when present, must be loopback. A browser attaches it to every
 *      cross-origin request and to same-origin POSTs, so this is the direct
 *      signal — but a non-browser client sends none at all.
 *   2. The `content-type` must NOT be one a form can produce. Those three types
 *      are the whole simple-request set, and being outside it is what forces
 *      the preflight this server does not answer — so a page that manages to
 *      omit `Origin` still cannot get a write through.
 *
 * ⚠️ The rule is "not a simple type", NOT "must be JSON", and the difference is
 * a real one this nearly shipped wrong: the avatar upload PUTs an IMAGE, and
 * `store.saveAvatar` reads that content type to decide the format. A blanket
 * JSON requirement would have refused every picture in the product while
 * reading, in review, exactly like the stricter and therefore safer choice.
 *
 * A request with no content type at all is left alone rather than broken,
 * because refusing it would break every non-browser caller (curl, a script) and
 * a form cannot produce one.
 * ⚠️ This used to justify itself with "a `fetch` with a body always sets one",
 * which is FALSE: `fetch(url, {method:'POST', body: new Blob(['…'])})` with a
 * typeless Blob sends no content type at all and is still a simple request.
 * What actually covers that case is the Origin arm above — a browser attaches
 * `Origin` to every POST — so the guard holds, and the sentence that said why
 * did not. Correcting it matters because the next person to touch the Origin
 * arm needs to know it is load-bearing here.
 *
 * Applied to every state-changing method, not only the new route: the others
 * are protected by preflight today, and depending on the browser's method
 * classification rather than saying so ourselves is how this was missed once.

  // ⚠️ THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY "it does NOT cross a new line", on the argument
  // that the server already lets a local process rewrite an agent's boot file.
  // That was FALSE, and measurably so: every other write is PUT or DELETE, which
  // a browser always preflights, so this was the first route on this server a
  // page on another website could actually reach. Running that request created a
  // worker directory and installed a launchd job on this machine. See
  // `crossSiteWrite`, which exists because of it.
  //
  // What it adds beyond the writes that were already here is PERSISTENCE: a
  // launchd job outlives the session that made it, and starts Claude with
  // `--dangerously-skip-permissions` at every login. So the containment is in
  // `engine/create`: the name is validated hard and early, no caller-supplied
  // path is honoured, every command is `execFile` with an argument array, and
  // any failure rolls the whole thing back rather than leaving half of it.
  //
  // ⚠️ Three things hold this up, not two: the loopback bind, the Host check,
  // and the cross-site guard. It should be behind a login the moment one
  // exists. The honest summary is that it is the largest thing here and it is
  // contained, not that it is safe.

   * name, and told nothing of theirs is being destroyed. The screen must not
   * compose that sentence itself, because a screen that writes its own

   *
   * ⚠️ It removes agents this product did NOT create, on purpose. An earlier
   * design refused them, reasoning that whatever set an agent up is what should
   * take it away. Josh reversed it: managing the fleet you actually have is the
   * point of the product, and an agent it cannot manage is a hole, not a
   * safeguard. What survives from that caution is that nothing of theirs is

   * (a room) and `msg` (types into ANOTHER AGENT'S terminal) — neither one

   * local process could make it. `resolveSender` ties the pane to a card on the
   * roster, so a body naming somebody else changes nothing.
   *
   * 🛑 AND A PANE IS A CLAIM TOO, said plainly because an earlier version of
   * this comment said "an agent can only ever write as itself" and that is
   * stronger than the code. Pane ids are enumerable —

   * exposure: that route types into a live terminal somebody can watch, and

   * because a message must cross into a terminal and may not arrive. This
   * writes straight into the record the screen reads: the append IS the

/**
 * ⚠️ Bound to localhost deliberately. This server writes and has no auth.
 *
 * It sets roles, stores avatars, records the commitments the restart
 * confirmation will read, and EDITS THE FILE AN AGENT BOOTS FROM. There is no
 * authentication of any kind.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT TYPES INTO RUNNING AGENTS. `POST /api/project/:id/thread/:agent`
 * puts arbitrary text plus a separate Enter into a live agent's Claude
 * session -- on a permission prompt, that is an unauthenticated caller
 * answering on behalf of an agent started with
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Added 2026-08-14, and added to THIS
 * paragraph the same day, for the reason the next paragraph records about
 * the last capability that went unlisted.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT CREATES AGENTS, which was the most powerful thing behind this bind
 * and was missing from this list while it was true. `POST /api/agents` installs
 * a launchd job with RunAtLoad and KeepAlive that starts Claude with
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions` at every login, and whose instruction file
 * any subsequent write here can rewrite. This paragraph is what README points
 * a reader at for "what protects it, and what does not", so leaving the newest
 * and largest capability out of it made the canonical statement of the posture
 * the least accurate thing about it.
 *
 * THREE ways that protection is lost, and only the first is obvious:
 *
 *   1. Changing this to '0.0.0.0'. A one-line edit that looks harmless and
 *      exposes every write endpoint to whatever network the machine is on.
 *
 *   2. A reverse proxy or tunnel pointed at this port. **Binding to localhost
 *      is not sufficient on a machine running one.** Tailscale Funnel, for
 *      instance, proxies `127.0.0.1` ports straight to the public internet —
 *      it is already enabled on the mini this was built on, publishing three
 *      localhost ports. Adding a route for this one would publish it too,
 *      without touching a line of this file.
 *
 *   3. ⚠️ A page on ANOTHER SITE, which needs no misconfiguration at all. A
 *      POST with a form content type is a CORS simple request: no preflight,
 *      and the loopback `Host` a legitimate request carries. Measured against
 *      this server before `crossSiteWrite` existed — a page on any origin
 *      created a worker directory and installed a launchd job. That guard is
 *      now the third thing holding this up, and it is the only one that
 *      protects a machine whose owner did nothing wrong.
 *
 * So localhost is a *default*, not a guarantee. Reachability and login arrive
 * together or not at all.
 *

 * 🛑 A FIX TO IT REACHED NOBODY UNTIL SOMEBODY MADE A NEW AGENT. `bin/agent-supervisor.sh`
 * is shared by every agent on the machine, and its own header says a change
 * there "reaches every agent the next time it starts". That sentence was true
 * of the FILE and false of the MACHINE: the only two callers of
 * `installSupervisor` are agent creation and the login-job repair, so on an
 * install where nobody happens to create an agent, an update ships a new
 * supervisor into the app bundle and the jobs go on running the old copy under
 * the data directory. Forever, silently, and the header explaining the update
 * model is what a reader finds instead of the gap.
 *
 * 🔑 THE BOARD RESTARTING IS THE UPDATE. Every update stops and starts this
 * process, and so does every login, so this is the one place that runs exactly
 * when a new supervisor arrives and never in between.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE WRITE IS RENAME-INTO-PLACE, which is what makes it safe to do under
 * running agents: every live supervisor is a `bash` process reading that exact
 * file by offset, so a new inode leaves them reading the one they started with
 * and they pick this up at their next start. `installSupervisor` already works
 * that way for the same reason; this is a new caller, not a new mechanism.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT FATAL, and it must never be. A board that refuses to start because it
 * could not refresh a script is strictly worse than a board running with the
 * previous one, which is the state every install is in today.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND NOT AT IMPORT. The routing tests require this module; writing files as
 * a side effect of an import is the same class as binding a port, which the
