/**
 * 🛑 THE LINE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN FOR IS GONE, and its removal is the point.
 *
 * 0.2.12 shipped "Replies come back there rather than here, for now" because an
 * agent had nowhere to write. The reply path gave it somewhere, so the sentence
 * became false four hours after it shipped — and leaving it would have told
 * somebody not to look at the box the answer had just landed in.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE LABEL DID NOT WORK EVEN WHILE IT WAS TRUE. Josh read it, waited,
 * apologised to his agent and asked again, with the sentence directly above the
 * box he typed into. A sentence explaining why a box does not do the thing it
 * looks like it does loses to the box looking like it does that thing. The
 * remedy was never better copy.
 *
 * What survives here are the checks that outlived it: the Settings row, and the
 * box's own two standing sentences.
 *
 * The line that stopped the direct box implying a reply it could not carry.
 *
 * 🛑 WHY IT EXISTS. An agent cannot write into a direct thread: the stored
 * record has no field for a sender, so every entry is the person's message to
 * the agent (#175). Meanwhile the box heads itself "Just between you and
 * <name>", which describes a two-way place. Josh said hello to a new agent,
 * saw the answer in her terminal, saw nothing here, and waited.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT FIXES NOTHING, and the test is written to that: it pins that the screen
 * stops implying the conversation, and that it says where the answer actually
 * is. An admission that leaves somebody with nowhere to go is half a fix.
