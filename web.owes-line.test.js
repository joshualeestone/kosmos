/**
 * "Nothing back yet" on the agent's own thread (#5).
 *
 * 🛑 THE ENGINE HAD THIS AND NO SCREEN COULD REACH IT. `messages.owesReply` was
 * implemented, exported and covered by twelve tests, and nothing called it: no
 * route, no payload field, no line. Fourth instance of that shape in a night.
 *
 * 🔑 A ONE-TO-ONE THREAD HAS NO ROOM-STYLE SIGNAL that an agent has gone quiet.
 * The room once carried a matching "Nothing back from ..." sentence; #3130
 * removed it and #3202 its plumbing (pjSilentSince), but this one-to-one box is
 * a distinct surface Josh kept.
