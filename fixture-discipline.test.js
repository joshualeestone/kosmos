   * 114KB file holding their account and their MCP servers.

   * the next suite — which is exactly how three roots came to be sandboxed and
   * a fourth not. So the rule is enforced here rather than remembered.

   * ⚠️ It reads the files as text, and text cannot tell a call from a mention
   * in a comment. That trade is deliberate: a comment naming `createAgent(`
   * makes this test fail LOUDLY and somebody re-words the comment, where the
   * clever version would let a real caller slip through a filter. This file's
   * neighbour tried the filter and it did not work — block comments here have
