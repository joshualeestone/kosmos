/**
 * An agent that is not running still exists, and the board says so (#278).
 *
 * 🛑 THE ROSTER CAME FROM `tmux list-panes`, so an agent with no live pane was
 * not merely unreported, it was absent. Josh's board read "1 Agents" on
 * 2026-08-22 while fifteen more sat in ~/work/workers with their instructions,
 * avatars and history intact, and the Projects tab one click away was correctly
 * saying "4 agents, 4 we cannot see" about the same fleet. Two screens, one
 * app, one moment, opposite answers (Mona Lisa).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ROW UNDER TEST IS ASKED FOR, NEVER WRITTEN HERE, which is
 * `test-support/fleet`'s rule and it applies with more force to this shape than
 * to any other: it is a row the ROUTE fabricates for an agent no producer has
 * ever seen, so a hand-built copy would be a description of what I meant rather
 * than of what ships. It comes from a real server against a sandboxed store,
 * and it is wrapped in the same strict proxy, so a renderer reading a field the
 * route does not emit throws instead of quietly reading `undefined`.
