/**
 * The create page's "let Kosmos know" box tells the truth about the second
 * gate (#258).
 *
 * 🛑 IT SHIPPED `checked` IN THE MARKUP, UNCONDITIONALLY. Sending is two gates,
 * both of which must be true: this box for one agent, and the standing answer
 * in Settings. So a person who had turned it off in Settings opened the create
 * form, saw a ticked box, made an agent, and nothing was sent. The screen was
 * showing consent to something the engine was about to refuse.
 *
 * 🔑 THE FORM ALREADY REFUSES THIS SHAPE THREE FIELDS UP, where Reports to is
 * hidden rather than offering a choice nobody can make. The difference is that
 * reports-to is IMPOSSIBLE and this is ALREADY ANSWERED, so the row stays and
 * says which: a row that vanishes teaches nothing, and the person who turned it
 * off is exactly the one who benefits from seeing that it took.
