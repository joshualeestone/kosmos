/**
 * After 0.2.99 comes 0.3.0, and the release script refuses anything else.
 *
 * 🔑 Josh, 2026-08-22: "since we are getting close, when we get to 0.2.99 then
 * lets roll to 0.3.00". A rule in a card depends on whoever is awake at 0.2.99
 * having read it, and at the current rate that is three weeks and several
 * people from now. The version is a bare argument to the script, so nothing
 * else stops `0.2.100` being typed at the one moment nobody is thinking about
 * it, and by then it is published and polled by every install.
 *
 * 🛑 EVERY RUN HERE IS AGAINST A COPY, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE WAS
 * NOT. It spawned `tools/release.sh` out of the repo the tests live in, and
 * `release.sh` derives its repo from its own path — so during `yarn release
 * 0.2.80`, step 3 ran the suite, this file ran the real release script with the
 * version in its argument, and that run bumped package.json, committed
 * "v0279 -- version" and PUSHED it, on top of the 0.2.80 bump made ninety
 * seconds earlier. The outer build then stamped the wrong version and the
 * release refused itself.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LESSON IS NOT "BE CAREFUL WITH THE ARGUMENT". A test that invokes a
 * tool which acts on the tree it lives in has no safe argument: the guard has
 * to be that the tool cannot see that tree at all. So the script is copied into
 * a temp directory with a package.json beside it, which is everything the gate
 * reads, and HOME and KOSMOS_SITE point there too — so the first thing the
 * script needs after the gate, a site checkout, is not there and it stops dead.
 * Before any bump, commit, push, build or deploy, and before it can even reach
 * the operator''s real repository or their real site.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND EVERY CASE ASSERTS THE COPY WAS NOT MODIFIED, because "it exited early"
 * is a claim about behaviour and the file is the evidence.
