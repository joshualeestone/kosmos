# UNCOMMITTED work with no warning. On 2026-08-21 that ate a real fix SEVEN
# TIMES in one day — twice it went unnoticed until a test written minutes later
# failed, and once a reverted state was committed on top.
#
# ⚠️ "Commit before you perturb" was written down after the first one and failed
# six more times. A habit that has to hold seven times a day is not a habit, it
# is a load-bearing assumption (Mona Lisa). So the tool holds it instead: it
# cannot run against work that a checkout would destroy.

# ⚠️ THE FILE LIST INCLUDES SHELL, AND IT DID NOT UNTIL 2026-08-22. It globbed
# `*.js` and `*.html` only, so `install/setup.sh` — the file a stranger's whole
# first impression runs through — was UNPROVABLE. Every mutation aimed at it
# reported "the mutation did not apply", which reads as a badly written
# expression rather than as a hole in the tool, and the two guards written for
# it that night were covered by tests that READ the file with nothing ever
# showing they could fail.
# 📌 `install/kosmos` is named explicitly because it carries no extension: the
# launcher is shell, it holds one of the three copies of the default port, and
# a glob by suffix cannot see it. A list that misses a file silently is the
# same defect one level up.
#
# 🛑 AND A MUTATION IN SHELL CANNOT BE PROVED BY THE NODE SUITE. `yarn test`
# never executes setup.sh; what covers it is `tools/test-install.sh`, which
# really installs. So a shell mutation must name that file as its test target,
# and it takes minutes rather than seconds. The tool does not enforce which
# runner you point it at — it cannot know — but the trap is worth stating: a
# shell break "proved" against a node test file goes green for the same reason
# the mutation used to not apply at all.

# 🛑 A SHELL MUTATION CANNOT BE PROVED BY THE NODE SUITE, and this refuses

# install/setup.sh or install/kosmos: it reads them, at most. So a break in
# shell "proved" against a .test.js file goes GREEN for the same reason the
# mutation used to not apply at all — the runner never touched the changed
# bytes — and a green run is read as "the guard held", which is the exact
# inversion this tool exists to prevent.
#
# ⚠️ REFUSAL RATHER THAN A WARNING. A warning printed above a green result is
# read as a green result; the whole point of this tool is that its output is
# trusted. Splinter's line when the glob was widened: the enforcement was "a
# person knowing", which is the thing we had spent the evening replacing.
#
# 🛑 BUT NOT EVERY NODE TEST OF A SHELL FILE IS WRONG, and the first version of
# this refusal blocked a proof I had legitimately run an hour earlier. A node
# test can READ setup.sh and assert about its text -- that every copy of the
# default port agrees, that a phrase is absent, that one block precedes another
# -- and mutating the file really does turn those red. What it cannot do is
# prove anything about what the script DOES when it runs.
# 🔑 The two are not separable by inspection, so the caller states which it is.
# `SHELL_READ_ONLY=1` is a claim, printed in the output, that can be wrong and
# be seen to be wrong; silence was an assumption that could not.
