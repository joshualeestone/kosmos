# deploy-site.sh -- deploy the marketing site (installkosmos.com) on its OWN clock,
# WITHOUT a Kosmos software release (#2014).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Marketing and copy changes (terms and conditions, copy touch-ups)
# should ship on their own track, in minutes, not wait for a full software release cut.
# The release still owns building and publishing artifacts; this script owns publishing
# the SITE. tools/release.sh already deploys the site as a step (site_deploy_export +
# vercel deploy --prod); this is that step, standalone, without the release around it.
#
# =============================================================================
# 🛑 THE HAZARD, and the whole reason this is not a bare `vercel deploy --prod`.
# =============================================================================
# site_deploy_export (tools/lib/site-deploy.sh) carries the installer artifacts from the
# site's WORKING-TREE dist/. Those artifacts are gitignored, so a raw checkout has NONE.
# And the export does NOT refuse on their absence: it prints
#     "carried: no pkg (dist/Kosmos.pkg is not in the site dist)"
# and PROCEEDS. That single line is the #1669 outage: a deploy from an unpopulated checkout
# replaced the live site with the tracked-only copy and every download 404'd for ~13 hours
# (2026-08-31). The file's own comment: "NOTHING REFUSED IT AND NOTHING COULD HAVE, because
# 'is this directory a release export?' was not an answerable question."
#
# 🔑 KEEP THE MARKER HONEST. .kosmos-release-export is the ONLY positive evidence that the
# carry step actually ran, and the deploy gate requires it. So this script must NEVER
# fabricate or bypass it. It FETCHES the current live artifacts into dist/ and VERIFIES
# them by sha, THEN lets site_deploy_export carry them and write the marker legitimately.
# The tempting shortcut -- set the marker and skip the fetch -- is exactly what re-opens
# the outage. The fetch is not caution; it is what makes the marker truthful.
#
# =============================================================================
# 🛑 REVIEW GATE. Baron owns the release/deploy pipeline. Do NOT run --publish against
# prod until he has reviewed this script. The dry run (default, no flag) is safe: it
# fetches, builds the export, runs every guard, and STOPS before any deploy.
# =============================================================================
#
# Usage:
#   tools/deploy-site.sh              # DRY RUN: fetch + verify + export + guards, then stop
#   tools/deploy-site.sh --publish    # the same, then vercel deploy --prod, then verify SERVED bytes
