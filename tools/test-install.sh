# The install lifecycle, as a runnable regression test.
#
# Everything the installer's comments describe as measured-and-fixed (the
# staged swap, the identity probes, the honest refusals, the reversible
# uninstall) was verified by hand at least once; this harness is what keeps
# those verifications true without a human re-driving them. It runs the real
# setup.sh, piped into `sh` from stdin the way the marketing line does, with
# EVERY root the scripts write to overridden into a disposable sandbox.
#
# ⚠️ NOT part of plain `yarn test`, deliberately: it needs the staged trees
# in dist/ (build them first: tools/build-tmux-bundle.sh and
# tools/build-kosmos-bundle.sh, KOSMOS_ALLOW_MINOS=1 for a dev machine),
# it binds a TCP port, and it starts and stops real processes. Run it as
# `yarn test:install` before shipping installer changes.
#
# ⚠️ SAFE ON A MACHINE WITH A REAL BOARD: the port is probed free first,
# every root is under mktemp, and nothing touches launchd or tmux state
# outside the sandbox (the launchd dir is overridden; the tmux ownership
# predicate keeps session kills away from anything not marked ours).
# LaunchServices too: setup.sh skips lsregister whenever a sandbox
# override is set, so sandbox bundles never enter the operator's real
# machine-global database (dozens of dead mktemp paths had registered
# under the production bundle id before that gate existed).
