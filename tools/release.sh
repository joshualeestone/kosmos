#
# ⚠️ THIS SCRIPT LIVED IN A SCRATCHPAD FOR THREE RELEASES. Every improvement it
# gained — including the step that copies `/setup`, added after the installer
# served on the site was found a whole change stale — would have died with the
# session that wrote it. A release procedure that is not in the repo is a
# procedure the next person reconstructs from memory, which is how the same step
# goes missing twice.
#
# ⚠️ IT DOES NOT VERIFY ANYTHING ITSELF. `tools/verify-served.sh` does that, and
# it derives the artifact list from the code that FETCHES each one. Two
# derivations of "what a user receives" is this codebase's worst habit, and the
# first one is what missed `/setup`.

# *"since we are getting close, when we get to 0.2.99 then lets roll to 0.3.00"*.
#
# ⚠️ A RULE IN A CARD DEPENDS ON WHOEVER IS AWAKE AT 0.2.99 HAVING READ IT, and
# at the current rate that is three weeks and several people from now. The
# version is a bare argument to this script, so nothing otherwise stops
# `0.2.100` being typed at exactly the moment nobody is thinking about it — and
# by then it is published, polled by every install, and in the versions page.
# Mona Lisa's call, and it is the same argument as baking the version rather
# than fetching it: answer it once instead of asking every future author.
#
# ⚠️ IT REFUSES RATHER THAN CORRECTS. Silently shipping 0.3.0 when somebody
# asked for 0.2.100 would be a release nobody named, and the entry they wrote on
# the versions page is stamped with the version they typed.

# `git describe --dirty` — which is honest and means the artifact people are
# running is not checkoutable. 0.2.11 and 0.2.12 both shipped that way, and both
# times somebody had to hash the bundle against a commit to establish that
# nothing unexpected was in it.

# commit means "what is this person running" is answerable only by comparison,
# which is exactly the question a release exists to make cheap.

  # check here measures the ARTIFACT and none of them asks whether the commit
  # the artifact is stamped at exists anywhere else.
  #
  # ⚠️ The whole reason for the paragraph above is that a version resolves to a
  # commit. A commit only this machine has does not resolve for anybody, so the
  # unpushed state defeats the stated purpose rather than merely being untidy.
