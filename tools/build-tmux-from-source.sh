#!/bin/bash
# Build tmux and its three dylibs FROM SOURCE against the macOS deployment
# floor, so the bundle we ship can actually load on the Macs we promise.
#
# ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. A binary copied off a build machine inherits that
# machine's OS as its minimum: the Homebrew tmux on this Mac stamps
# minos 26.0 (measured with otool), and dyld refuses to load a dylib built
# for a newer OS than the host -- so a bundle made from it works on the
# build machine and on NOTHING in the supported range. The floor gate in
# tools/lib/floor-gate.sh refuses to pack such a bundle for release; this
# script is what produces one it will accept. MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET at
# compile time is what stamps the floor into every artifact.
#
# ⚠️ THE FLOOR COMES FROM tools/macos-floor, the same single source the
# gates read, so this builder cannot drift from what the installer promises.
#
# ⚠️ SOURCES ARE PINNED BY VERSION AND CHECKSUM. The four tarballs come
# from the projects' own release URLs, and each download is verified
# against the SHA-256 recorded below before anything is compiled. To bump
# a version: change the version, run with KOSMOS_TRUST_FIRST_FETCH=1 once
# (it prints the measured hash and refuses to finish), record the printed
# hash here, run clean. A release build never runs on an unrecorded hash.
# ⚠️ HONEST LIMIT: the recorded hashes are trust-on-first-use, measured by
# this script from an https fetch (downgrade-proof via --proto), not
# cross-checked against upstream signatures. Cross-checking against the
# projects' published signatures/hashes is the upgrade, on the release
# security list beside artifact signing.
#
# Output: a self-contained prefix at <out>/tmux-floor-prefix whose
# bin/tmux links the three freshly built dylibs. Feed it to the bundler:
#
#   TMUX_SOURCE=<out>/tmux-floor-prefix/bin/tmux tools/build-tmux-bundle.sh <out>
#
# The bundler's collect() picks up the prefix dylibs, rewrites their load
# paths, re-signs, and the floor gate certifies the result -- with no
# KOSMOS_ALLOW_MINOS override, which is the whole point.
