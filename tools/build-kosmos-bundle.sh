# Build the Kosmos app bundle the installer downloads: kosmos-<arch>.tar.gz,
# containing the app, a private Node runtime, and the `kosmos` command.
#
# The installer (install/setup.sh) extracts this into $KOSMOS_HOME and expects:
#
#   bin/kosmos          the command (install/kosmos, this repo)
#   runtime/bin/node    a Node that runs from a home folder on a clean Mac
#   app/                server.js, engine/, web/, bin/, package.json
#
# ⚠️ WHY A WHOLE NODE SHIPS. The app is dependency-free by design (node:*
# builtins only, no node_modules), so the ONLY thing between a clean Mac and a
# running board is a Node binary. macOS does not ship one, and asking a
# non-technical person to install Node is the install we are replacing. The
# official arm64 binary is ~50MB on disk and ~30MB compressed, which is the
# bulk of this bundle; that is the price of "paste one line".
#
# ⚠️ THE RUNTIME IS DOWNLOADED FROM nodejs.org AND CHECKSUM-VERIFIED against
# the SHASUMS256.txt published next to it, then the four files we take keep
# Apple's own signature (nodejs.org macOS binaries are signed and notarised;
# re-signing them ad-hoc would replace a real identity with none). The version
# is PINNED, not "latest": the bundle must not change under us because a
# release day happened.
#
# ⚠️ NODE_SOURCE overrides the download for offline builds and tests, same
# pattern as TMUX_SOURCE in build-tmux-bundle.sh. A bundle built that way is
# for TESTING: a Homebrew node links only system libraries today, but the
# release bundle is built from the official binary, always.
#
# Usage:  tools/build-kosmos-bundle.sh [output-dir]
# Output: <out>/kosmos-<arch>.tar.gz plus the staged tree it was made from.
