# Build a RELOCATABLE tmux that runs on a Mac with no Homebrew.
#
# ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A STATIC BUILD.
#
# macOS does not ship tmux. `/usr/bin/tmux` does not exist, measured. And the
# board is built from `tmux list-panes`, so tmux is not a nice-to-have that can
# degrade into a warning: without it there is no product. That makes shipping
# tmux the single hardest part of a one-command install.
#
# The plan assumed this meant a static build plus Apple signing and
# notarisation, and costed it as the most expensive option. Both halves turned
# out to be wrong:
#
#   1. NOTARISATION IS NOT REQUIRED for our delivery shape. Measured: an
#      ad-hoc-signed binary with no Apple developer identity runs fine from a
#      home folder, and still runs when carrying the quarantine attribute a
#      browser download sets. Gatekeeper's notarisation check applies to apps
#      being LAUNCHED, not to a command-line binary a script executes.
#
#   2. (Historical framing -- see the source-kinds note below: the RELEASE
#      path now compiles from source via build-tmux-from-source.sh, so the
#      release toolchain does include a compiler; what stays true is that
#      the USER's machine never needs one.) A STATIC BUILD IS NOT REQUIRED
#      EITHER. tmux links against exactly three
#      non-system libraries (utf8proc, ncursesw, libevent_core). Everything else
#      it needs is in /usr/lib, which is on every Mac. So the binary and those
#      three dylibs can simply be copied and their load paths rewritten to
#      `@executable_path`, which is what this script does. No compiler, no
#      autotools, no build dependencies. The result is ~1.8MB.
#
# ⚠️ COMPILED-IN PATHS DEPEND ON THE SOURCE TMUX, and this script accepts
# two kinds. A RELEASE build takes tools/build-tmux-from-source.sh's
# floor-targeted prefix, whose artifacts carry no build-machine paths at
# all (measured with strings: config path is /etc/tmux.conf:..., terminfo
# is /usr/share/terminfo baked in). A HOMEBREW-sourced TEST build carries
# two /opt/homebrew strings -- the tmux config search path (harmless; the
# file will not exist on a clean Mac) and ncurses' compiled-in Cellar
# terminfo directory (would bite, which is why the installer pins
# TERMINFO_DIRS to the system location regardless of which build shipped).
#
# Usage:  tools/build-tmux-bundle.sh [output-dir]        (default: dist)
# Output: <out>/tmux-bundle/{bin,lib,VERSION,THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt} and
#         <out>/tmux-<arch>.tar.gz (+ .sha256), ad-hoc signed, relocatable.

# missing one is still in /opt/homebrew) and fails on a clean one. That is the
# whole class of bug this script exists to avoid, so it must not be introduced
# by the script itself.
# ⚠️ `deps_of` EXISTS BECAUSE `set -o pipefail` MADE AN EMPTY RESULT FATAL.
# The first version piped straight into `while read`, and a library with NO
# non-system dependencies (libutf8proc is one) makes `grep` exit 1, which under
# `pipefail` + `set -e` killed the script MID-LOOP.
#
# It failed in the worst possible way: the load paths had already been rewritten,
# so the bundle looked finished and correct, but the script died before the
# re-signing step. The result was a plausible bundle with an INVALID SIGNATURE,
# which macOS refuses to execute on arm64. Caught by running it and checking the
