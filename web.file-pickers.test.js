 * Every place a person picks a picture looks like the same product.
 *
 * 🛑 TWO OF THE THREE SHIPPED THE BROWSER DEFAULT. The create form had a real
 * button over a hidden input; the agent's own page and Settings had bare
 * `<input type="file">`, which Chrome draws as an unstyled "Choose File / No
 * file chosen" in a product where every other control is drawn. Found by
 * looking at the rendered Settings screen rather than by reading the markup.
 *
 * 🔑 AND THE BUTTON IS NOT DECORATION. The comment on the create form records
 * why it is a real `<button>` rather than a `<label>` wrapping the input: a
 * hidden file input is out of the tab order and a label is not
 * keyboard-activatable, so the label-only version makes it the one control on
 * the form a keyboard cannot reach.
